We were looking to purchase our first home in the Seattle area and Kayla was recommended to us from our friends.  She had just helped them find their first home.  As first time home buyers, we didn't know  too much about the whole home buying process and Kayla was always incredibly helpful and knowledgeable regarding all of the questions we had.  She was always available, which was so impressive, but is also really important because the Seattle market does not always allow for lots of time to make decisions.  She helped us look at a lot of houses so we could find the perfect one for us.  When it came to the bidding process she worked with us closely, and coached us on strategy all while keeping our best interests in mind.  We felt 100% confident she was going to put us in the best position possible to win our bid.  If you are looking to buy (or sell) a home in the Seattle area, you should absolutely connect with Kayla!"

10448,0.4976851851851851,"Matt and Ian were excellent! They helped us buy a home about a year ago. This was our first home purchase, and they were great. Matt had an introductory meeting to get to know my partner and me and what we were looking for. They were very patient driving us around town to see homes. We saw a ton of homes to get a feel for neighborhoods and what we wanted in a home. They made the process fun. We found a house we loved, except one thing about it. Matt and Ian were great about saying they would help us buy it if we wanted, but they recommended we keep looking. I am really glad we kept looking! Ian found a home that was slightly below our square footage requirement, which meant we never would have seen it in our own search, but it had a better floor plan than homes with more square footage. We ended up buying it and are very thankful they prevented us from buying the first home we liked. We ended up in a home we love much more. I would use Get Happy at Home again for a purchase."

He gave us spot-on advice about what to fix on the house, and what things to not over-invest in rehabbing. We were able to keep our renovation budget below what we expected and the house was in excellent and beautiful shape. Geoff even helped us do some interior painting when I ran out of time before moving out of state. Most importantly, Geoff was great in helping my wife and I set the list price for our house. He was very patient with us as we asked torrents of questions. Geoff made videos of competitor houses on the market, which gave us good insight into the market. He is very analytical -- a numbers guy -- which fit us well. The house sold for substantially above list price. We could not be happier."

We paid for the packaging service and unlimited packing materials, and it was so worth it. Everything was packed in a way as to not get damaged. All furniture was wrapped in moving blankets and/or wrapped in Saran wrap.

They also were really good at estimating the cost, amount of movers needed, and amount of time required.

When we were moving into the new place, we mentioned we wanted to put felt pads on all the legs of the furniture so as to not scratch the floors. We meant that we would do this but just needed to intercept, but they went above and beyond by putting the felt pads on our furniture for us!

I appreciated his approach and it was reassurring to feel that I was not being ""upsold"".
I felt I recieved honest advice from Danny when viewing properties & especially appreciated him offering tips on items to watch for (wood siding vs. vinyl) that may impact the long term value and maintenance of the property.

11053,0.43787878787878787,"Geoff was great to work with! He has all the qualities of a great buyer's agent, including: knowledge, experience, responsiveness, and a pleasant demeanor. While Geoff excelled in all these areas, I especially appreciated his approach of always looking out for the buyer, even if it meant the loss  of a quick transaction. Geoff always promotes assessing homes objectively and minimizing risks, yet is still able to write very competitive offers. In fact, I was able to buy a home without the highest offer by incorporating some of Geoff's strategies. It is because of this, I found Geoff to be an agent that I could really trust!"

They took me to see what i wanted to see and pulled me away from the edge when they saw anything funny that may not have been in my best interest.  Id give them more stars if i could.

The movers took great care of my things and assembled and disassembled everything with ease. They were friendly, pleasant, and professional. Everything I could have ever asked for. I had Damar and Charles move me and I recommend both of them if you have a choice.

It‚Äôs a shame some moving companies out there can be shady and scammy but Phoenix express is nothing of the sort and the owner takes everything about his business personally, as he should, so just know you‚Äôll be getting good service.

Great business overall and a well earned five star review. Keep up the good work!"

2083,0.436468253968254,"Finding Guinevere and the team at Every Door happened by chance, and I feel incredibly grateful that I was able to work them!  The search for my perfect home was driven by me, with tremendous support from Guinevere.  As we toured homes and discussed what was important to me, she was understanding, talked me through the things I wasn't familiar with, encouraged me to see things in a different way when it was beneficial to me and was entirely flexible when I changed my mind about what was most important!
Guinevere's guidance and expertise in how we would craft my offer to ensure it was competitive was essential to getting me into my home!  As soon as the home was listed, she sent the listing my way, knowing it was perfect for me.  I asked her how quickly we could see it, and she was flexible enough to get me a showing at the first available time that day.  After we walked the house and the yard, I looked at her and said, ""Okay, what do we have to do?"" and she immediately walked me through her vision on what it would take for the owner to accept my offer on a beautiful, competitive property.
I value working with kind, intentional, experienced, supportive people.  From finding the perfect home with Guinevere, to the timely and clear communications from the rest of the team, down to an amazing recommendation for getting my flooring replaced!  This team was phenomenal and I will highly recommend Guinevere to all of my people in the future."

She gave us very good list of lenders specific to buying a manufactured home on leased land. This was so needed!  We contacted quite a few lenders unwilling to finance  such properties! Once we had an accepted offer Crystal made a calendar for us to keep us on schedule, that was awesome!  Negotiating the price after the home inspection was great.

1316,0.43504464285714284,"My husband and I first got connected with Jarrett last fall when we were considering listing our home in West Seattle.  He came over for an in-person visit to give us a fair market report and introduce himself and his brokerage.  We were impressed and knew that we would use Every Door when the time came to list.
We listed in late spring in a difficult market (pandemic, West Seattle bridge closure) and though our home didn't fly off the market, Jarrett worked his tail off to find us the right buyer, and I'm happy to say that we close in a few days!
Jarrett was always incredibly responsive when we had a question, and his confidence that our home would sell helped ease our fears.  Every Door spares no expense in marketing your home, and hires the best of the best for the listing pictures and video walk-through.
We are also using Every Door to help us buy, and I have no doubt that that process will go smoothly as well.  Can't say enough good about Every Door and Jarrett Coulson!"

The estimate will be leaps and bounds off from what the movers will attempt to charge you on the day of moving. We were quoted one price and then the movers called the day before to get an estimate of what was to be moved (although everything was on the paperwork) and charged us more money. On the day of moving they wanted to charge us THOUSANDS of dollars more the original estimate for the exact items on the estimate. When we called concerning the original estimate, they told us it was at the discretion of the moving company. This is a scam. We ended up having to rent our own moving van to move ourselves out of Florida."

He is excellent at communication and continues to reach out to us today to make sure we are doing well. As you can imagine, many questions come with being a first-time homeowner. Doron has years of expertise in this area and even after our purchase, has given us helpful guidance on how to set up and maintain our home. This same attention to detail extends to the rest of the team that we worked with at Weisbarth and Associates. We also appreciated working with Doron‚Äôs home inspection team who made sure we felt comfortable before finalizing our offer which Doron was able to negotiate under asking price. Doron clearly loves what he does and this is evident in the exceptional quality of service he provides. We cannot recommend him enough!"

11422,0.4061538461538461,"We enjoyed working with the Get Happy at Home team throughout the house hunting process.  Matt and Ryan took the time to tour different areas and home types to help us get an idea of what was achievable in our budget. They are knowledgable in renovation scope and upgrade costs, which opened options we wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise considered.

We were most impressed by offer process. Matt explained options to craft a competitive offer, reviewing in detail to help us understand the strategy. Matt made sure we understood and were comfortable with the entire offer with no pressure to include anything we were weren‚Äôt completely comfortable with. This was not the first time we have tried to buy a home, but Matt‚Äôs insight was invaluable.

Through closing, the team was very professional and communicative.   We would recommend Get Happy at Home and plan to use their renovation team for future upgrades."
9176,0.4059548611111111,"My wife and I are first-time homebuyers. We both knew Zach from college, and were so excited to work with a trusted friend throughout our first-ever home-buying experience!

Zach went above and beyond each step of the way. He never hesitated to say ""yes"" when my wife and I stumbled upon one, two, or three houses that looked like winners, and quickly asked to go view them (""Drop everything - we have to see this one!""). On countless occasions, he offered up his time to meet us somewhere to chat during weekdays or weekends, call us to check-in or explain more of the complicated steps in the home-buying process, and email back after we'd ask close to 15,000 long and detailed questions (well, maybe not quite that many...). He provided an outstanding level of education to help us learn along the way - using his own videos to teach us things while we were at home or on the go - so that everything in the process was transparent and understandable. Zach never hid information from us, and approached each conversation with a genuine desire to see us make a wise decision - one that would be best for US.

We were particularly impressed by Zach's expertise on the Greater Seattle area housing market (he's done a TON of research and knows his stuff!!!), and his understanding of what makes a winning home offer (he helped us bring our A-game to the table and succeed with our first and only offer!!!). Every one of his recommendations was solid, too, whether it was for a particular loan officer or home inspector, or for some things to be mindful of when viewing a house and how it's laid-out, constructed, or maintained.

Bottom line: Zach is the man. We absolutely LOVED working with him. We felt so valued as his clients during the home-buying process, from start to finish. He inspired confidence each step of the way, and we couldn't have asked for a better or more ideal person to be on our team for this experience. We would relish the opportunity to recommend Zach to anyone looking to buy or sell a home in the area, so they could have the same wonderful experience we did. Thanks again, Zach! :)"

11289,0.405026455026455,"Johnine is a delight. We worked with her five years ago when buying our first home, and when selling that home this year. Johnine is so much more than an agent -- she worked with us for almost a year in a tough sellers market when we first bought, giving us real, honest advice about when to bid more vs when to give up (and not overpay).

She helped us during the interim period -- with connections to contractors, but also with advice about where to invest our money (what would be a good investment if we decided to sell vs what we'd be doing for ourselves).

That advice really came in handy when we did sell (for a profit) five years later. But what was the most impressive to me was that Johnine gave the advice willingly because that's the kind of person she is -- smart, helpful, and there for her clients...whether or not we ever sold our home again."
10606,0.40499999999999997,First time homebuyers and we were so fortunate to find Danny.

3216,0.4030555555555556,"So this a two-part review, because I ended up hiring these guys twice in the same week. They were that good.

First, Damien, Walter and Gamez did an excellent job the first time around! They were on time and moved the furniture we requested during our estimate. They put protectors around the doors and walls, so they wouldn't get scratched while they were loading stuff.

Based on our estimate we only needed 3 movers and medium sized truck.. My husband and I had planned to move other boxes ourselves. Well that did not happen LOL. We were so wiped from everything else, that we hadn't even finished properly packing.

Cue Wildcat move part 2. I called these guys up again and asked if they could finish packing and move the remainder of our stuff (because at this point - I am OVER IT). Joseph was awesome to work with and provided me with another quote and was able to fit me in within a couple of days.. seriously THE BEST!

I also have to say I love the way the quote process works, being able to facetime them and walk around our house to show them what we need to have moved so they can provide an accurate quote is a game changer.

This time I worked with Byron and Edwin. They both did an excellent job of packing everything and loading it in the truck. They even helped me load the boxes of liquids (detergents, cleaning products, etc.) into my car.

Both experiences were GREAT and I would highly recommend Wildcat Movers - Dallas."

While we didn't appreciate it that first weekend, we quickly learned how lucky we were. Bunna is amazing; he's incredibly personable, kind, and funny, but also gets it done! He was always super responsive and made himself available for showings whenever we requested. When we found our perfect home, he used his magical powers to lock us in at asking price (something unheard of in the current market). During the closing(buying) process, he was so patient attending every one of the inspections and continually answering our unending questions. Overall we're so glad that Bunna found his way into our lives, he gave us the best ending for our first home buying experience. We will be highly recommending Bunna to our friends."

That said, Eco-Movers has been great. They made moving as pleasant as it can be. Each crew was fantastic.

6105,0.38839285714285715,"We had a move from Lewisville, Texas to the Fort Sill, Oklahoma area. We needed our household goods plus a storage unit moved. From the beginning with the initial quote from Beau, to the awesome packers (Ashley, Allison, and Chloe), to the 6 moving crew members (with 2 trucks), Phoenix Express was amazing!

Being a retired military member, I have moved many times in my life. I don't think I've ever had a more professional, friendly, and caring group of people help with a move.

They weren't the cheapest, but I had a gut feeling that they were the right crew to choose. I was not wrong. Plus, if doing interstate moves, you will want to ensure that your movers are licensed/insured to do so. Even though some may say they are, it will behoove you to ensure they are, otherwise, you may find your household goods stuck at the state line. Beau provided great information about the requirements as well as all their information that showed compliance.

I highly recommend Phoenix Express!"

We appreciated how he got to know us as prospective homeowners and were impressed with how quickly he was able to send us listings tailored to our tastes and price range. Our list of ""asks"" in a home was a  bit more complex than the average buy, but Zach was never discouraged in our search. His confidence and optimism kept the process enjoyable, and we would highly recommend him to any prospective buyer!

We looked at over a dozen homes in a short period of time and felt like we were the most important clients she had! We got the second home we offered on all because of Monika‚Äôs knowledge, professionalism and charisma! As first time buyers we had lots of questions along the way.

Danny's communication was excellent from day 1. He was always very prompt in his responses and demonstrated an incredible depth of knowledge in his field. We also needed some work done on our home to get it ready for market and Danny was great about getting us referrals for specific jobs that helped maximize our homes sale price. At the end of the day, it was the smoothest ever real estate transaction we've ever been a part of. We also received more for our home than we expected.

824,0.3863873106060606,"These guys earn the 5 star Reviews.
I used Phoenix Express for a 2 part move between McKinney and Leander, 215 miles apart.  We had our house in McKinney loaded up in May without issue. On time, nothing broke, no walls damaged,  everything ran perfectly.  The 2nd part of the move kept getting delayed due to our new house schedule pushing out.  Once we got confirmation on the perfect day for finishing our move, I was a little nervous.  Keep in mind,  they had to travel all the way from Dallas to just North of Austin in Leander.  They arrived promptly at 9:30AM Saturday morning and performed spectacular again.
The estimated cost of the move came in within 10% of the original quote despite the extra burden we put the team through.  I recommended this team to a friend of my Father's for a long distance move and he was also another pleased customer.  Can't recommend Jeff and Angie enough.
Great people, great team, and as pleasant of an experience that moving everything you own after 32 years of marriage can be."

He helped put together a great offer on the very first house I liked, which was accepted! Happy to work together on future house buying/selling!"

From the initial consultation to the moment we received the keys to our home, Ryan provided an incredible level of service that exceeded our expectations.

What truly set Ryan apart was his commitment to ensuring we didn't feel rushed or pressured throughout the home-buying journey. He listened carefully to our preferences and ultimately led us to a property that exceeded our expectations. We are now proud homeowners of a place that truly feels like home.

From our first showing to closing day, she was there reassuring us with her professionalism and kindness every step of the way. Not only did she help us find the perfect lender, but she was able to negotiate a winning offer on our dream home in an almost impossible housing market. I truly do not believe we would have been able to win a bidding war and close on a home if it were not for Janine. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you!"

9022,0.38512396694214873,"I note that Josh is a 'five-star award winner.'  I don't exactly know what that means in the real estate world, but it fits perfectly.  Josh navigaged our fraught real estate deal with cranky neighbors and indecisive clients with the greatest aplomb.  One would-be client backed out; he took that in stride and gently adopted some new tactics to prevent it from recurring.  During all of this he was calm and level-headed.  He knew just how to prepare and present our rather strangely decorated place to the greatest advantage."

3258,0.385,"Had a pretty good experience with Wildcat Movers. I haven‚Äôt moved in over a decade. I discovered them after receiving a flyer in the mail. The initial call was so thorough. Prior to move day I received a confirmation request and move details again, as promised. The crew of movers were communicative, timely, productive throughout and so very professional. I was impressed too with how well and respectfully they communicated with one another. I recommend you ALWAYS call the office if you run into an issue after the move like I did. The office is responsive and supportive. I would recommend using them."

Very professional, on-time, efficient and a pleasure to work with. They handled quite a task of carrying items from a 3-story townhome up to a lofted apartment with two flights of stairs without any issues as well as reassembling furniture. Megan who helped coordinate the move was a pleasure to work with as well and kept me informed prior to the move of all details. I also liked the ability for a virtual call so she could see the space and provide an accurate estimate. Will recommend to others and use this company in the future!"

This team never once complained, were very respectful, kind, and so careful with all our belongings. They‚Äôre pricing and service surpassed all our expectations.
Moving can be so stressful, the crew was positive and assured me they‚Äôd work until the job was done. Never had a better moving experience‚Ä¶Absolutely the best!!!"
6322,0.38462962962962954,"The best moving experience we could have dreamed of. They packed and moved us and it was seriously worth every penny (though a much cheaper penny than several other quotes we got). The packing alone was wonderful and very thorough. Then we were even more blown away on moving day- we had a 6 man crew and 2 huge trucks arrive at our door. The care they took- flawless. Even down to taking apart our furniture and securing the screws and washers to each respective piece so they didn‚Äôt get lost.
I will be recommending Phoenix Express to anyone I know that will be moving. You can tell it is a true family-run business. All of the employees were so incredibly respectful and kind. You don‚Äôt find service like this anymore."

9759,0.384375,"I recently had an opportunity to work with Eunice Lee on a home project and I can tell you she possesses the most important qualities of a person and real estate agent that one can have.

The guys they sent over were very friendly and had great attitudes.  The quote/estimate I was given was accurate when I paid.  They told me that the move would be about two hours and the moving guys stayed on schedule.  It does help when you have your items/boxes already packed and organized.  It helps the move go more efficiently.  I recommend AM Moving Company and I will continue to use them in the future."

9184,0.38333333333333336,Sharon Ashlaya is the best! I love working with her because she takes the time to understand what I am looking for and then goes into action. She asks the property managers more questions that I can even think of about the apartments and is always thinking about my needs as we tour and discuss facilities. She is also very timely with her clients. I called her Thursday and we were out looking at apartments on Saturday. She is a valuable resource to any of her clients and I have shared her information with multiple friends in the Dallas area

We both were overwhelmed knowing the market is competitive and folks we knew took more than 6 months to find a house and get an offer accepted. We found Lili online and we decided to work with her, that was the best decision we made. From the start she was always on top of it, she walked us through the whole process via zoom call. She helped us throughout the process, finding the exact options for houses matching the criteria we mentioned, which helped us a lot to shortlist the houses to actually visit in person. Main help was also in helping us identify what we like/prefer and not. This helps a lot in prioritization and avoid the confusion. She helped us get inspection reports in time,  getting market data analysis in time when we were putting offer. She also helped us with contacts with lender for better options. At the end we beat the 10 buyers to get the first house we put offer on thanks to Lili. Her communication, contacts and strong negotiation skills got us the house we really loved and wanted. She is the best agent we have worked with. We highly recommend her especially in these really competitive times!!!"

4936,0.37810606060606056,"I have moved a lot over the years and Dalton, Clark, JC,  Eli were the best movers i have ever had. Even when i moved furniture for 20 years i never worked with anyone as good as them or as professional. They wrapped everything way better than when the furniture came new! They took care of everything as if it were their own furniture.  Their attitudes through everything that happened were super positive and never negative. (The person that was supposed to be out of our house wasn't yet)  If i ever move again or know anyone who is moving i would definitely recommend wildcat movers."

3/21/23 update: my husband and I used Wildcats movers again and by far the best moving company we have ever used! They quickly worked in the rain to bring all my furniture into our house. There wasn't even water/mud anywhere (they had towels down to step on and wrapped all the furniture). HIGHLY recommend to use Kel and Jose! What a great team and an amazing company!"

She was incredibly patient as I navigated my way to the sweet spot between my dream house and what I could afford. She ultimately led me to a home in a fabulous neighborhood that I wasn't too familiar with, but that I ended up falling in love with. She has tons of energy and enthusiasm, and she instilled a lot of confidence in me throughout the process. Now, ten years later, as I contemplate a move, I wouldn't consider working with anyone else to list my home. Kim is experienced, knows the market, and will work her butt off for you. She responds quickly to texts and e-mails, and she will be your best advocate. She is a gem in the industry."

She took time to learn about my needs and wants in a home, and then looked out for houses that would be a great fit. She regularly provided feedback that allowed me to skip looking at houses that wouldn't ultimately be a fit, which I really valued. She also provided great input on the houses we looked at. Her expertise, honesty, and excellent communication make her a wonderful individual to work with.

7895,0.3772222222222222,"I have had many experiences with real estate agents and transactions. Rob is hands down the best agent I have ever worked with. He went above and beyond to make everything work for my extremely busy schedule. He found the house of my dreams after two visits to properties. He gave excellent advise about pricing and offers and has a level of transparency that I appreciate about fees and services that is exceptional. After winning the bidding war, he continued to have excellent communication with me. He also took care of a few outstanding house issues without me even asking and without charging me for his time or services. I had concerns about an outlet and he fixed this as well as a garage door sensor issue. Then to top off the experience he also has helped me get my old property rented as a favor to me. I can't recommend him enough. He is, in my opinion one of the top 5% of agents out there in skill, dedication, and honesty. I feel so lucky to have worked with Rob and I would be happy to field any questions from any one about him and recommend him without reservation ."

I used for listing and paid $0 and named my own buyers commission % etc. The buyer agent was pleased to actually not have to work with another realtor to cut out the middle man. Richr was not pushy to up sell/sign me up for anything either! They do offer title service which I didn't use (but wish now I had). I didn't due to the buying happening on a weekend and the buyer agent wasn't comfortable and couldn't get a hold of since most title places are closed on weekends. That said, USE THEM! It supports them AND it's the same people that I dealt with already whom I can say have been GREAT!

I imagine using them for buying is just as good plus the cashback etc. So help support this amazing company with great people who saved us thousands!"

Right from the start, Zach impressed me with his knowledge, experience, and enthusiasm for the project. Admittedly, I have pretty high expectations since I am a real estate attorney in Seattle. Zach did an excellent job marketing my house and everything was first rate. Zach easily earned his commission and put extra dollars in my pocket as well.

Rocky stayed on top of all my paperwork and kept me calm when I was about to break. I was very picky with champagne taste and beer money but that did not stop Rocky from finding the best house for us. He never gave up on us. He is the type of realtor that will not settle for anything but the best for his clients. Rocky is a hard worker and I highly recommend him for your realtor needs."

He was the perfect blend of relaxed attitude, sharp knowledge and immense professionalism that made us always feel confident that he was giving his best, honest advice and never felt misled or pressured in any way. He was an excellent communicator, never delayed in his responses and always helped us view properties in a timely manner. If he wasn't able to be there himself, he had a team member there to help who displayed a similar level of professionalism and punctuality. We received excellent recommendations for a home inspector and mortgage assistance and felt we were well taken care of by everyone. In a home buying environment that was incredibly competitive, we managed to have only our second offer accepted, and avoided many restless evenings wringing our hands with anticipation. We credit Geoff with keeping us on track, ensuring we were making the right offer on the right property, and giving us the strongest offer package he could by carefully considering our contingencies and escalations as well as personal touches that we included. We will work with Geoff again, without hesitation, should we decide by buy/sell another property, and he is still in the business.

Rob was recommended to us by our selling agent.  He is the best realtor we have worked with (buying and selling 6 houses over time).  He works very hard to match you up with a house and neighborhood that is right for you.  He is a skilled negotiator and goes the extra mile to get you the best price and terms available.  He also has great contacts for loans, sub contractors, etc.
We highly recommend him and feel very lucky to have had him as our realtor."

Jenny helped coordinate the move and was very helpful and informative. We only moved from Oaklawn to Ross Ave and they were amazing !!! We got Juan's crew which I couldn't be more happy with . They were on time , quick , and did not damage a thing ! I was also nervous about being charged all these fees at the end which did not happen .

Jeff and Angie were able to get me on the calendar, and they sent a competitive quote. This is truly a remarkable group of people who do wonderful work at an affordable price.

Lindsey and Alissa came on Wednesday to pack. The ladies did a superb job. Thorough and organized, they packed up everything in the house that the movers wouldn't load themselves, and it was all labeled for easy reading and it was all packed for safe travels.

The next day, Alex and his crew came in and loaded up the entire house in three hours. I was very impressed with their speed and efficiency. They didn't cut any corners, and I didn't have to worry about anything.

And on Friday, a trio of guys met me in Arkansas to unload everything. Brandon, Hunter, and Damar were a pleasure to work with. Despite having to lug everything up a STEEP driveway, they finished in about five hours. All the furniture was rearranged and reassembled, all of the boxes were carefully placed in the right rooms, and the whole truck was emptied. I appreciated how much effort they put into the process given the circumstances of the move.

From beginning to end, Phoenix Express Moving took care of me and my family during the moving process.

Both crews showed up on time and after a quick walk-through, turned on their music and got to work.  I was super impressed by their hustle, attitude, and care they took with our possessions.

237,0.3595389107017013,"I used Phoenix Express Moving for my move on Labor Day. The experience was completely amazing from start to finish. I was preparing to move from Dallas to New Jersey, but the majority of my stuff was going to San Antonio (my hometown) - either in a storage unit or to a separate location. Moving is stressful as it is, but this particular move had a lot of moving parts, was on a holiday & in the middle of the pandemic, so it was even more stress than normal. Jeff (the owner) answered the phone & immediately calmed my nerves & assured me that his team could handle whatever it was that I needed. He said he would text me a list of the information that he needed me to provide. I received the text less than 2 minutes after hanging up the phone & as promised, he had a quote to me that evening. Not only was the quote provided quickly - but it was a fair quote. His prices are competitive with all the other moving companies that I called, but the experience, professionalism, timeliness & customer service is so beyond exceptional & beyond what I encountered in any of my conversations/negotiations with other moving companies.

I used packing services from Phoenix. Savannah & Chloe arrived on time & did an incredible job! They were FAST & everything was handled & packed with the greatest of care. I realized the following day that the island cabinets had not been packed. When I contacted Phoenix, they said they would get someone over asap & Chloe returned to pack the missed area within the hour. She could have been irritated/frustrated that she had to return, but she was just as pleasant as the day before & took the same care with packing as before.

On moving day, the loading crew arrived 15 minutes early. Charles, Josh & Demar were absolutely incredible! They disassembled everything & they handled everything with care. When I would say, ""Oh my goodness - I forgot this or that - can you do this?"" they would respond happily with, ""Absolutely!"" or a ""Happy to take care of that for you, Ma'am."" All 3 of them were so kind, professional & FAST. Even though they were fast, they were METICULOUS with their work. The thought & care that went into every item that they handled, loaded & packed was beyond impressive.

Both the packers & all 3 movers truly handled my belongings as if they were their own personal treasures. I was also impressed with the precautions taken to protect all of us against the spread of Covid. Overall, I could not have asked for a better experience with a moving company. From start to finish, the process was professional, stress-relieving, safe, effective & as absolutely pleasant as a move can possibly be.

PLEASE - if you are moving locally, in-state or out of state - do yourself a favor & hire Phoenix Express. I am so glad that I did & I guarantee, you will feel the same way! If I ever move again, I'll be saving up money to convince Jeff to send his team all the way to Jersey - b/c I would never want to use another moving company again!

Thank you to the entire Phoenix Express team - you all are just doing moving & business the RIGHT way!"

11207,0.3594577352472089,"In the summer of 2019, my husband and I made the difficult decision to move across the country for a new opportunity on the east coast. The most stressful part of this was finding a good realtor who we could completely trust to sell our townhouse.  We knew we had to find someone who was reliable, knowledgeable, and proactive. We found all that and more when we worked with Rob.

Rob did an amazing job staging our townhouse and making sure we put our best foot forward when it was listed on the market.  His communication was transparent and reliable, which was critical to relieving stress since we were already living on the east coast.  He was relentless and creative in making sure we were getting visibility during a difficult market (i.e., hosting a pumpkin carving event that had a great turnout). When we did receive an offer, he did everything possible to make sure that we were getting the best deal.

We are incredibly lucky to have found Rob to sell our townhouse. I would highly recommend him to anyone who is looking to buy/sell."

More extended story:

Chris went out of his way to make sure I had a great experience. I was a first time homebuyer who did not know how the US processes works, but Chris helped me answer my questions even when they were related to other areas such as the loans and escrow.

He always kept my email flowing with new listings, and he had clearly already filtered out homes that might have been great but not for me.

I was very impressed with the speed at which he moves. I remember one time I stumbled upon an open house while walking around town and even being a Sunday, Chris managed to make some last minute arrangements to make some time to go see it that same day in order to give me the best advice.

Whenever I need to buy or sell anything I will be calling him again."

10331,0.3538095238095238,Matt is an awesome realtor! He helped us navigate the very treacherous Seattle housing market.

Through the whole process, Rob and his team were sure to check in multiple times throughout the week to proactively ensure we were always working in the right direction for an on-time close.

Where we were truly impressed is with Rob's negotiation skills. He pulled multiple rabbits out of the hat and was ultimately able to land us a home at a very favorable price in a competitive market.

Rob, Susan, Lessa, the entire Bushwick team are top notch professionals. And beyond their professional expertise, we felt them to be extremely trustworthy and honest, which to us as first time home buyers was very important. I would not hesitate to recommend Rob & team to friends or family.

Thank you Bushwick Real Estate!"

If I could give Xpress Renovations 100 stars, I would.  Moving is difficult enough.  Add to this that I live in New Jersey and was responsible for moving my 95 year old mom from her spacious 2 bedroom condo to a small one bedroom apt. in Assisted Living in Miami, and you have the makings of a nightmare.  Enter Joseline of Xpress Renovations, the only person of the 5 moving companies that I contacted who was incredibly responsive to my questions and concerns, and worked to make everything as smooth as possible for me. When I flew into Miami, Joseline had all the pieces of my move already coordinated perfectly for me. I cannot recommend her highly enough!  Also amazing and impressive was the Xpress Renovations crew that helped me make the actual move, headed by their top notch guy named Andrew.  Andrew and his crew were beyond awesome.  They had integrity. They were competent and efficient with the time. And most important, they got the job done for me without a glitch, with everything arriving at my mom's new apt. in perfect condition.  You could not possibly hire a better moving company than Xpress Renovations!! I HIGHLY recommend them."

On moving day our team was timely, efficient and friendly all while carefully moving our belongings.  Dan and Brian were a great team and knocked out the entire job quickly while providing great conversation with us.

For any moving needs in our future I will definitely go with Easy Company again."
8485,0.3534065934065934,"The guys were cool. Especially Jovani. Very very nice. They did a good job and moved pretty fast.

Only thing I‚Äôd say is to communicate more with customer on how they want things placed inside their storage. I almost forgot to tell them bags in front. I forgot to tell them make sure I could get to certain things and have room to move around in the front so I can get and add things.

I‚Äôll be using AB to help me move out of the storage into apt when it‚Äôs time. Definitely recommend. Being the most affordable didn‚Äôt take away from their speed or quality.üëèüèæ"

They made themselves available to me for extended periods of times (spent 2 full days searching), which was important given how fast the market has been moving. As I wasn't sure what I wanted, they showed great patience helping me narrow my search and gave me great advice as to what neighborhood and type of home would fit me best. Most importantly, the team's main focus was helping me find the right place for me, versus pushing properties on me in order to make a quick sale. I really appreciated the honest, expert advice I was given, the team's patience through the process and their flexibility and willingness to meet with me multiple times throughout the process. Thanks for all your help!"

He has been in the industry a long time and understands all the intricacies and options available. He is a great professional and a very kind person.

10879,0.3507841810966812,"We had an amazing experience working with Ron! As first-time homebuyer, we were really cautious and interviewed many agents before deciding to work with Ron. It turned out to be one of the best decisions we made. Ron was always prepared and professional, from leading a tour to writing offers and all the way to closing. He is super knowledgeable about houses, from construction materials to small details like door joints. I was surprised and impressed that Ron even climbed into attics to check the house condition--something not many agents do nowadays. Also, his communication was top-notch; he was always available to answer questions, give updates, and offer advice right away.
On top of that, his great offer and negotiation skills helped us snag our dream house in this crazy hot market!

Overall, our experience with Ron was exceptional. His expertise, communication skills, and dedication made our home-buying journey super positive and successful. I highly recommend working with him if you're looking to buy a home."

They are moving across the country to be closer to us so we decided to get a large container for their move to fit everything they want to take with them. The only problem was that my parents had a lot of stuff including some heavy/large furniture. There was no way they would be able to do all the packing and loading themselves and we couldn‚Äôt fly to LA to help them at this time, so we really needed to find good moving company as soon as possible.
We contacted several moving companies about their packing and loading services, but decided to go with Pure Moving because a lot of our friends recommended them and I am happy we did. My parents had excellent experience with these guys.
I was not there on the day of the move, but my parents remained very very happy! My father said that all the guys were very friendly, professional and careful with the furniture, boxes and fragile items, making sure everything is packed and loaded properly so it doesn‚Äôt get damaged or broken.
Also they finished loading the whole trailer much faster than we expected, my father said he was very impressed  with the excellent work."

They were patient with us during our first time home-buying process, taking the time to educate us on different neighborhoods and types of homes, what we should look for and ask about when visiting open houses, and all the other (overwhelming!) ins-and-outs of home buying. Never once did we feel pressured to make a decision, even when we completely changed directions on what we were looking for. Despite hearing all of our friends say that home-buying in this climate is incredibly stressful, we found the opposite‚ÄîRob's team made us feel supported, heard, and capable of making the best decision possible. AND they managed to cinch us a beautiful Phinney Ridge home at asking price, quite a feat in this market!

9633,0.3476082251082251,"I strongly recommend that anyone selling a home talk to Tod Franklin before listing with another agent.  I did a lot of research and interviewed many realtors, and I am confident that I made the right decision. Tod‚Äôs photos and listing details were excellent. He sells 10 times more homes each year than the other realtors I talked to, and this experience means he can offer great advice.

Many of the realtors I interviewed bragged about how many of their listings had multiple offers on the first day. This made me suspect that they priced the house too low in order to make a quick commission. I decided to price my home a bit high and wait for a good buyer. I had more than a hundred showings in a few months, and sold for a very good price. Tod never pressured me to accept a low offer.

I saved several thousand dollars in commissions. Tod responded immediately every time I had a question. I recommend this company for anyone selling a house in the DFW area."

He found the type of houses that I was looking for, and in that saved me a lot of time concentrating on potential good fits.
During the offer, Geoff was always there for me. Helped me to understand each step in the process, negotiated with the sellers, and me feel supported while making sure I understand everything.

Being novices in the real estate market, we really benefited from Marc and Kim's real estate acumen in deciding on the right house and the right offer amount. Kim worked with us on the house we ended up buying and she really made the whole process very smooth for us and ensured we closed on time!

The icing on the cake was the hefty rebate we got from WaLaw Realty which helped cover all the closing costs and on top of that we were able to reduce the purchase price of the house.

I would love to work with them again!"

10435,0.3407509157509158,"As a first-time home buyer, I could not have asked for a better real estate agent than Justin Day. He was patient with my questions, thorough with his explanations, and extremely responsive. Two things stood out to me while working with Justin in my home buying journey: 1) it was clear he had my best interest in his heart (vs. getting the transactions complete). He even dissuaded me from buying a couple houses that I just didn't feel 100% for, and pushed me to not settle for a property that wasn't my dream house. Just a month later, we were able to close on a home that was PERFECT for me!  2) Justin has fostered really tight relationships with local lenders. I don't think I could have moved as quickly as I did if Justin hadn't been proactively connecting with the lender so we were in our best position to compete in this market. I would recommend Justin to anyone any day, and he has me as his lifetime client!"

Luis, Segundo, and Eligio treated my well loved but rickety furniture like it was precious heirlooms, wrapping and strapping and rolling and toting everything so quickly and expertly. And they were great to be around too - we all put that to the test when I totally changed my mind about something halfway through and it made more work for them, it was taken as completely normal. Their experience showed in every part of the process, from alerting me to arrival, to staging through challenging access points, to having to manually haul a big couch with no complaints up six flights of stairs because turns out I hadn't measured my elevator accurately.

And the final charges were right in line with the estimate, too, money very well spent for such a worry free experience. A coworker had used them twice and praised them to the skies and I am so happy I listened. Thanks again to everyone involved."

He paid attention to what we like and has a great at sense for finding places that we were actually interested in, rather than just showing for showing's sake. Once we found a place we were interested in he helped us make a strong offer and put us in a position to be at the top of the seller's list of possibilities.

Padding equipment and additional packing supplies were provided so that everything was well protected and all my items arrived looking untouched. They were also very good about communicating, sending reminders, and asking questions so I could feel assured through the day.

I had a situation where I needed to take an appointment and leave for a bit, but I felt very safe leaving the movers to take care of my things. At the end, I noticed my drawers which had been crooked for about 2 years üòÖ were also straightened and corrected, which was very nice!!

Would definitely recommend this moving service for anyone moving in the Seattle area. ‚≠êüëç"
3247,0.3391666666666666,"The crew were very friendly and courteous.  They did a very good job.  They found my watch under the bed and returned it to my pleasant surprise.  However,  the move took 10 hours.  I moved 2 years ago in reverse direction using another mover for 7 hours with the same and several more big pieces of furniture.   So if you have no budget, hire them.  Otherwise there are more efficient movers.  I wish I use the same mover as last time."

My agent, Katie Rorbach, guided me through the whole process of buying my condo with great communication and patience. Her hard work resulted in a great deal for a home that I felt really captured my interests (and budget). What also impressed me was how smoothly closing went thanks to the effort of Katie and her team at Every Door. Everyone was very responsive and helpful, and I did not feel deceived or pressured in any way. If you are looking for a real estate group that cares about its clients and takes the time to listen to their interests and questions, look no further than the Every Door team :)"

His last text was trying to figure out numbers and that was it. Never said once that we can't make this deal happen which would of been fine instead of not responding at all.

Darcie is unassuming, good natured and friendly. She takes the often overwhelming experience of real estate and makes it digestible and tangible for her clients. She is a good negotiator and her personable nature made us feel well-cared for and relaxed throughout the entire home-buying and home-selling process. She explains things clearly and is quick to respond to her clients.  She has many years of experience and knows the Seattle market well. She gives great advice and guidance when asked for, but is ultimately supportive of her clients specific wants and needs. Darcie is who you want to cheerlead you through the process of real estate!"

Leandro's communication skills are outstanding. He was always prompt in responding to our inquiries, and he kept us informed every step of the way. Whether it was through phone calls, emails, or texts, Leandro made sure we never felt out of the loop.

What truly sets Leandro apart is his commitment to follow-up. Even after the lease was signed, he continued to check in to ensure everything was going well and to see if we needed any further assistance. This level of dedication is rare and greatly appreciated.

Thanks to Leandro's expertise and hard work, my daughter now has a wonderful place to call home in Miami. I highly recommend Leandro to anyone looking for a realtor who is professional, communicative, and truly cares about his clients' needs. Thank you, Leandro, for your exceptional service!"

Luis and Felix handled my move, and they were very professional, careful, and efficient. They had all the right supplies to help secure my things and move them smoothly through two apartment buildings and elevators. They worked hard and did a wonderful job to complete everything within the quoted timeframe. I also used the HiveBoxx service, which was a really smooth experience -- I highly recommend. The boxes are very sturdy and come with a wheel dolly for easy stacking and moving. They deliver and pickup the boxes according to your chosen moving window. It really helped streamline the process and it was nice to have durable, reusable materials to use for moving.

They walked me through it, and were there every step of the way. I have since bought (and sold) three more houses with the Gals, and it was a great experience every time. They are highly respected throughout the industry, and know how to put together a winning offer. I wouldn't work with anyone else!"
10774,0.33717948717948715,"Chris was our broker while searching for a house in Seattle/Bellevue. We worked with Chris during the last year and he was very thorough at explaining us the pros and cons of every area we were interested.
When we went to a house he would be very vigilant on making sure everything was correct. He pointed out to all the issues the house had and helped us navigate inspection reports, lenders.
He was very quick at understanding what our family needed and help us to make sure we did not waste our time visiting houses that we would not like.

When we visited a house, he was on time and he might even have already checked all the house in advance. He would raise his concerns if there were and allow us to make a much better decision. He never pushed us to make any decision and was always on top of the market and timing with sellers so that we could make a competitive offer. At the end, he was very helpful as we found an awesome house in the area we wanted. I would definitely recommend people working with Chris."
6131,0.3371527777777778,"Working with Every Door, specifically our agent Abigail, was just the best experience we could have hoped for when finding our first home. From the start with our home buying introduction meeting, every question was met with understanding and informed (and very speedy!) responses. We were super intimidated by the likelihood of finding a home in the Seattle-area market and were pleasantly surprised to have such a calm and measured approach towards looking at potential homes, the pre-inspections, and finally getting our offer together.

I couldn't believe it at first when she said we could be in a home before the end of 2021, but here we are getting our keys on December 6! Abigail is truly wonderful to work with and we recommend her to anyone looking for an agent in our area! :)"

We went through a couple of agents prior that we did not feel had our best interests at heart. Angela was a breath of fresh air who shared her vast knowledge to educate us and ultimately got us into a home that we love in a great neighborhood. She got us our house even though the seller was extremely difficult and caused many road bumps along the way. We could not be more greatful to her.

We tried to sell our townhouse and buy a single-family home through a major real estate company (name rhymes with ""muffin""). Despite the premier concierge experience that we opted for; it was overall a disappointment. We ended up taking our townhome off the market and not buying our dream home. Get Happy at Home Team rescued us! They provided us a personalized service, curated the right homes for us, staged our townhouse like a dream and sold it within 3 days of listing. The attention to detail from the entire team was amazing. There was constant communication, status updates and transparency, every step of the way. And it didn't hurt that they have a wonderful sense of humor, which makes buying in this competitive market much less stressful. Thank you for everything and for helping us get happy at home :)"
10565,0.3363095238095238,"It's not easy to find a RE Broker who really differentiates him or herself from the rest.  Abe Ash is one of those Brokers.  We just closed on a difficult-to-sell property in Brickell (don't ask!).  Abe was honest, straight forward, concise and communicated perfectly with  me and all the parties.  More importantly, he fought for this sale, constantly on the phone with the buyer, the bank and loan underwriters, creatively overcoming challenge after challenge to get this done.  We are more than happy with his work, and I would recommend him to anyone looking to sell or buy real estate in South Florida if you want someone who will make it happen!"

Since he is knowledgeable about homes and has been in this business for some time he was able to bring things to our attention that were vital in our decision making. We found our dream home and took his advice into consideration to put our best/competitive offer forward. Everything went smoothly with him from start to close.

10925,0.33608150470219433,"I cannot say enough nice things about my experience with the Get Happy at Home team.  A dream job brought me to Seattle, and Matt and Ian helped me find a dream home to match.  A friend in the real estate business referred me to this team, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier.

First and foremost, Matt and Ian are fantastic listeners and they took a lot of time getting to know me.  Through the process they were able to narrow in on the perfect neighborhoods and homes that fit not only my aesthetic, but also my lifestyle and values.

While searching for homes, I always felt like I was in good hands.  If Matt or Ian found something troubling about a property, they weren‚Äôt afraid to mention it.  Looking at houses can be an emotional process, and it was reassuring to have two objective sets of eyes pointing out the things that I would not have noticed.  In the end, they helped me purchase the most beautiful home in the most wonderful neighborhood.  I told them that I wanted to find my dream home, and they delivered.

Overall, it was downright fun working with Get Happy at Home.  I met Matt and Ian during my first week in Seattle and they were the first new friends that I made in this wonderful city.  The only downside to this home purchase is that I no longer have the excuse to spend all of my weekends with these guys looking at homes.  I would highly recommend this team to anyone in the housing market."

Roy is patient and intentional in how we supported me and my family during the stressful and chaotic home buying process. He always took the time to explain the different steps and put things in terms that we could all understand.

When our rental home flooded our timeline for buying a house got pushed up rather quickly and Roy and the Divas were incredibly helpful to us in finding our forever home in a tight market.

The cherry on top is that the Divas is an organization that lives their values and my family and I feel really lucky that we got to get to work with them."

Erik is the perfect professional - he's industry-savvy with expert experience of how a real estate deal works from beginning to end. And easy to work with.
He does what he says he‚Äôll do. Like getting us the answers/document that he said that he would send to us. Or like checking under the sink for signs of water if he said he would. And every showing was conducted on time whether it was in person or using zoom/google meet. We appreciated that he‚Äôs factual, patient, and that he pays attention to details.
We‚Äôll refer anyone in our network that needs a real estate agent to Erik. We were always sure that he could advise us, with our best interests in mind, on how to proceed.

Danny was able to show us that we can trust him practically from the first contact by pointing out that the we can buy this property at lower price that it was posted which was quite unusual and encouraging for us - -no wonder that the rest was a very easy ride downhill.

It was our pleasure to buy our property with Danny's help and we will use his help in the future for sure."

Brian was the key our home being sold smoothly and at a desirable price.  He put in many days of effort to improve the home and made it look amazing. Ian took over in the offer stage and guided us through the process in his reassuring manner. Amber was prompt and provided us with clear next steps.

By the end of the process, my wife and I have come to trust the Get Happy At Home team immensely. They are at top of their game in the Seattle area market. We would love to work with them again."

She helped me put together a weekly list of homes to tour, and was nice to entertain some of the delapidated shacks I had found (pictures are deceiving!).  She had great input during our tours, often bringing up aspect of the home or it's condition that were not obvious to me.  Once we found the right home, she moved quickly to get our offer in and knew where to find hidden opportunities that other realators don't know or don't care about.  I don't think I would have ended up getting the house without her help.  I would absolutely work with Angela/Every Door Real Estate again!"

Mallory came recommended by a close family member. I had no knowledge of the home buying process and truthfully did not think I was ready to buy until I spoke to Mallory.

From the beginning, Mallory exhibited a remarkable level of patience, guiding me through every step of the home-buying process. As a first-time homebuyer, her expertise and willingness to explain things thoroughly were invaluable, making the entire experience smooth and stress-free.

What sets Mallory apart is her dedication to going above and beyond. She consistently demonstrated a commitment to excellence, especially when it came to coordinating meetings, facilitating communication, and inspecting build quality for my home. Mallory's attention to detail and proactive approach ensured that I had all the information I needed to make informed decisions.

Mallory's professionalism, knowledge, and genuine concern for her clients' needs make her an outstanding realtor. I am truly grateful for her support and advocacy, and I wholeheartedly recommend Mallory Adams to anyone in search of a dedicated and reliable real estate professional.

5716,0.3325347985347985,"My daughter and her husband had used this moving company twice and were extremely happy, so I did the same after having a not very happy experience with another company. I was impressed with their efficiency, quickness, competency and skills. I not only used them for the storage move, but also ended up getting a quote from them for a move to another state, as well as unloading the first truck that had been loaded onto a Upack 26-ft trailer. They moved everything out of storage in Florida and loaded it on their truck, later driving to Alabama and unloading it, as well as unloading a 26-ft trailer that was also full. They were worker bees in constant motion and they got the job done. I was very pleased and happy that I had made the right choice. I highly recommend you use Xpress Relocations for all your moves - local or interstate. You will be happy you chose them!"

He is very knowledgeable about navigating the Seattle market and was able to help us purchase a home in a competitive, multioffer situation. We weren't even the highest offer!

Rob is well connected to both the real estate and contractor communities. He was able to give us solid advice about home repairs and remodels and connected us with competent handy-persons to get all of our needs met. He gives realistic assessments of properties, e.g. homes that are way overpriced or homes that are in need of major repairs.

We recommend Rob 100%!"

Thanks guys! Patrick dsgley"
10087,0.3315789473684211,"I don't know where to begin as the whole experience was easy, valuable, pleasant and very, very educational.  I am a professional woman myself and have a tendency to evaluate other businesses and I have to say wholeheartedly, that Richr was as professional as it gets.  I sold a huge house with a guesthouse in a ""small-house"", gated community and was worried I wouldn't be able to do it without listing with a traditional realtor.  Serena and Glenn and the whole Richr team were valuable partners in this transaction along with saving me a lot of money :) They were very patient with my ignorant questions and always responded immediately.  Listing, staging and showing your own house or rental isn't easy but they sure made it much easier.  I have already told several people about this service including house flippers who want to pocket more money after the sale.  Thank you Team Richr for everything!!!!"
8385,0.3314814814814815,"Great experience, the movers were fast and efficient. The price is somewhat expensive but there were no hidden fees, everything was done upfront.

Both of them were careful with our things and so so sweet throughout the entire process (even though it was in the triple digits yesterday!).

It was a fantastic experience and we couldn't be happier with the result."
757,0.33104166666666673,"I would highly, highly recommend using Leneya Ludwick at Every Door Realestate. She helped me find the dream house and navigate the very stressful and extremely competitive Seattle real estate market. I personally had a difficult time consistently putting the effort required to successfully purchase a house in Seattle. I was outbid on 5 houses and I was really depressed and worried that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get into a great house. A friend referred me to Leneya ludwick and I am so grateful. Leneya has an amazing ability to be optimistic and happy on every house visit we went on. This was huge for me. It‚Äôs scary buying a house and her amazing optimism and knowledge of the local market put my mind at ease and made me BELIEVE that my agent was going to make it happen. True story, 2 weeks later I had the house of my dreams and at a price point I feel incredible about. After my experience I reflected on the agents I used before Leneya Ludwick and I have to say in the stressful market of Seattle having an agent who displays huge optimism, knowledge and confidence makes for a really great buying experience. I would highly recommend using Leneya Ludwick of Every Door Realestate for your house or condo searches. She is awesome at what she does."
9706,0.33100180375180377,"I highly recommend using Pure if you‚Äôre moving to or within the Miami area. They had the most reasonable pricing of all the quotes I received, were incredibly responsive and helpful via text, and the guys were very friendly and quick with the move. I drove down to Miami from Boston and dealt with challenge after challenge but this company made things a bit easier and alleviated the headache of getting all my stuff into my new place!"

Since the For Sale By Owner website wasn't bringing me any buyers, I thought I would try the Richr free MLS listing offer.  They sent me the paper work to sign and I read it all and it stated that their service would be free.

I was contacted by Serena (very sweet) and she asked me for all the info on my property and she posted it to the MLS.   About a month later I had my buyer.   I was not obligated to pay any thing to Richr."
1112,0.3309565434565434,"My husband and I were extremely hesitant to begin looking for a new home, for many obvious reasons. We went back and forth for weeks and finally decided to take a peek at the possibilities. We are incredibly thankful that we connected with our realtor, Kevin Farber. From start to finish he was so kind, informative, honest and gentle with every single one of our concerns. We truly couldn't of asked for a better realtor to do business with! If you are hesitant like we were, I urge you reach out to Mr. Farber, he will guide you honestly and swiftly! Thank you again for everything!"

4728,0.330823112073112,"Bolsun and Samuil from Pure Movers were great. We had to get things moved from a storage unit and our one bedroom to our new place, and they were able to do it all in one day. They arrived super promptly at the beginning of their quoted arrival window, and they were efficient and pleasant, even though our place was a bit of a disaster zone (lived in for 5 years and through pandemic quarantine). They moved furniture, boxes and bags we'd prepacked, and kitchen appliances that were too heavy for us to handle easily wrapping ourselves. They even managed to get our entire storage unit full of stuff that was only kind of packed into their truck in just an hour. The emailing process prior to the move was also super easy. Everyone was responsive and very friendly. I would definitely recommend them for a move and would happily use them again."
4600,0.33075757575757575,Ryan L and Edwin were super helpful and cool. We had them move a lot of our bulk furniture to our storage unit and they did a great job and handled everything with care. We will definitely be using them again when we need to move into our new place!

11963,0.3306344696969697,"In the Seattle real estate market you not only need a good agent, but you need someone who's been in this area and has connections.  It's even better when this agent provides such top-notch customer service that you barely have to do anything but receive updates, be part of the negotiation and sign some documents.

I both bought a house with Rob and sold a condo.  He coached me through the best way to bid and to win (it's not always the highest bidder that wins), and then he coached me through how to prepare and present my condo for sale and went ahead and took care of everything for me from having a handyman come out to do touch-ups, and getting cleaning and staging taken care of.  And all the while he checked in with me at least once a week and picked up every time I called.  If you want top notch customer service and a trusted adviser who will get a deal done look no further.

UPDATE: We moved, had Rob sell our Seattle house, and two years later we moved back to Seattle.  We utilized Rob and his team for buying another house in Seattle in this super-competitive market, and we couldn't be more pleased with the house we just bought.  Rob and Team- THANK YOU!!!   We know you had to work hard for us for this one, and finding us an electrician in this market for the new house was super appreciated.  Transaction number 4 and awesome yet again."
10385,0.3305555555555556,"I got in touch with Geoff based on a recommendation from a friend who stressed to me who just how patient and awesome Geoff was to work with. It turns out that he wasn't exaggerating.  As a first-time home buyer, and someone who started out not knowing what I wanted in a home to being fairly specific about my home purchase needs, I really needed someone who was going to be patient and willing to help me navigate all of the many unknowns with regards to the home purchasing process. Geoff was that person. I had all my questions thoroughly answered regardless of whether they were simple or complex and he always made himself available (or had an assistant readily available) whenever I wanted to look at a home -- because in this market, you have to act quickly if you see something you really like. He always gave me space to make my own decisions about a property and I never felt pressured in any way, which made me want to continue working with him in my yearlong search. When problems do arise,  whether with a loan or with the property, he's extremely responsive and will offer his help however he can (and did).

He went WAY out of his way to try to find the best apartment for me and went above and beyond, making calls and contacts that I would have never expected. He was incredibly smart with the way he approached the negotiation process. In such a hot market, this is incredibly important. I know if he had not been my realtor, I would NOT have been able to secure my current home. He figured out a way for me to get this place and Im soo thankful."

10256,0.32997364953886693,"Simply put, we wouldn‚Äôt have our new home without the expertise of Matt, Ian, and the Get Happy at Home team. Their experience and extensive knowledge of the industry is incomparable. They take what could be a tense experience and add joy and levity to the home buying process.

We had been looking at houses for a couple of months without success when an acquaintance referred us to Matt. We never had a real estate agent take the time to get to know us and our preferences the way he did. Matt encouraged us to think creatively, but pragmatically, and addressed all our questions and concerns honestly and with compassion and humor. Ian and Amber were regularly available to show us properties and point out potential in situations where we were uncertain, all the while remaining calm and encouraging. The whole team was always responsive to our questions via email or text.

When we found a home that we felt was perfect for us, Matt crafted an offer that helped us stand out from the others. In a time where housing inventory was low and multiple offers were the norm, our offer was chosen though it wasn‚Äôt the highest. You can imagine how much we‚Äôve referred others to Matt and his team based on our experience!

We are so grateful for the Get Happy at Home team ‚Äì because of them, we are truly very happy in our new home."

The home buying experience didn't go as smooth as we would have liked but with Zach's negotiations we were able to make up the difference. He was on time, professional and well mannered.

From the beginning, I knew Dexter and his team were the right groups to help us find the right apartment with the views of Miami that we desired! They showed signs of having key attributes, which is a requirement for optimal performance. Dexter's Learnability attribute shined right after the first review of listing options. There was where he was able to learn what we liked, didn't like, and what things were nonnegotiable (such as a minimum of 2 parking spots, and that was mandatory for my wife). Dexter and his team showed signs of Self-efficacy with the number of listings and options they kept presenting. They demonstrated their high Adaptability skills when the market prices started to increase and their Resilience to find us the best apartment we could have imagined. After the search mission was completed, we turbo through the rest of the process. With the Discipline of Dexter and his team, we were able to get through the HOA process, all walkthru's, and leasing agreements in less than seven days. We moved into the apartment seven days after first viewing the apartment, all thanks to the Brando Group.

11042,0.328030303030303,"We felt so lucky to be in the capable hands of Danny and Tekesha. They were both incredibly responsive, detailed, helpful, hard-working, and easy to work with. For us, this meant so much, since we were buying from out-of-state and were often touring homes virtually. Tekesha provided such wonderful and descriptive detail of each home we toured, that I may not have noticed had I been there in person. Her insights were invaluable and made touring homes virtually so much more vivid. When we toured the home we ended up purchasing, even the listing agent commented on how descriptive and helpful Tekesha's tour was-- we felt lucky to have her. Danny provided quick responses and sharp assessments of each house that caught our eye. It helped us build a better lens for reviewing the quality of homes before touring. Danny provided an in-depth look at each stage of the process to ensure we understood exactly what was happening/why. Despite buying a home previously, we were much more informed working with Danny. His analysis was crucial in determining an appropriate price point that ultimately led to us finding the perfect home. We couldn't have done it without them and will definitely continue to recommend Danny and Tekesha to all our friends."

Finally, the biggest thing for me and my wife is trust. That's not something you easily find with agents.

Gave great advice in coming a little over asking price, high enough to prevent a bidding war with another interested party.

We did an honest walk through, she pointed out the few deficiencies, she's assisted me with the lender and the title company.

Not my first house-buying-rodeo.  She's as good as the best I've worked with.  If the rest of Every Door is reflected by Janine's work, it's a high quality company.

Costs were as good or better than you will find with their competitors.  The extra value, in terms of responsiveness and honesty, makes them the best choice.

I will use them again in the future."

We were able to work through the process, timelines, listing and other activities in our own time (no push from him) and he helped us plan with thorough research on the price/market conditions/selling. Overall, we feel that Doron and his team (Lisa) helped us and the buyers get a good deal and all parties were happy at the end of the sale!!"

I have now worked with Tod for about 4 years and always have a great result. His service and communication are excellent. I even recommended him to my sister when she had to sell.

He helped me cultivate a plan within no time and by the end of our first week working together I‚Äôd seen quite a few properties and obtained a plethora of information regarding the potential areas of interest.  He was very professional and knowledgeable of the market.  By the second week of working together we‚Äôd narrowed it down to a beautiful unit in Downtown Miami. From that point forward Abraham was able to swiftly guide us into the next phase of our purchasing process in which he was also very knowledgeable in.  He communicated effectively with our mortgage lender, facilitated information between us and seller very clear and concise and was very effective in providing us with all the resources we would need to solidify our purchase.

11200,0.32017704517704526,"Working with Abe on our journey to find the perfect condo in Miami was an absolute dream. From the get-go, it was clear that Abe was not just any realtor; he was a master of his craft. His extensive knowledge of Miami, down to the most intricate details of every building in the area, made our search process incredibly smooth and efficient. It was as if he had an encyclopedic knowledge of Miami real estate at his fingertips. Whenever we showed interest in a building, Abe effortlessly provided insights that were precisely tailored to our needs. For instance, when we mentioned a specific building, he immediately knew that only the 3-bedroom units faced the water, and since we were looking for a 2-bedroom with a water view, that building wouldn't suit us. This level of detail and personalization in his advice saved us countless hours of research and helped us narrow down our options much more effectively.

Abe's expertise extended far beyond just finding the right building. He was incredibly knowledgeable about all aspects of the buying process, offering advice and guidance on permits needed for remodeling, and more. His proficiency was so notable that during one of our visits, a seller's agent even mistook him for a contractor. This just goes to show the depth of his understanding and his commitment to helping us in every possible way. Abe was not just a realtor; he was a guide, a consultant, and a problem-solver all rolled into one. His dedication, expertise, and genuine care for our needs made our condo search in Miami not just successful, but enjoyable.

For anyone in search of their dream home in Miami, stop your search for a realtor and call Abe. He's truly the best in the business, and we couldn't be happier with the outcome of our journey with him."

They were kind, QUICK, careful, and DETAILED. They asked questions all along the way to make sure they did everything to my standard. Before they even started wrapping my furniture, Hugo noticed that the legs on my couch were wobbly, and tightened them for me without hesitation and REPAIRED my TV stand that had a wood piece come unattached- what a dream. Not only did all of my belongings arrive and were placed in perfect condition in our new house, but they were clearly in BETTER condition AFTER this move because of their very helpful hands. With all that is going on in the world right now, I felt safe and in great company with these guys. I will definitely be using these guys for my next move."

THEIR SERVICE. We had scheduled our move time and provided a deposit when a family emergency occurred that forced us to rethink our plans. Kyle refunded our deposit and wished me good luck without a moment of pressure or hard sales. Honestly it was a real breath of fresh air.
So yeah, read the other reviews to find out if they‚Äôre good movers‚Ä¶but believe this review when I say they‚Äôre good PEOPLE."

6312,0.3194444444444445,"Tod was great from the beginning. He took my wife and I through the whole process step by step. Then Tod came to take the photos of the home which were fantastic. The quality was to par with the best I have seen on the web. Lastly, once the home got on the market we had wide exposure, and sold the home quickly, and for what we needed. If we had a standard realtor, and the fees to go with we would have paid extra money for the same if not lower quality of service. I would recommend Tod to anyone in the Dallas area looking to sell their home. Tod you were awesome, thanks for everything."
11939,0.3194444444444444,"Josh helped us search for and purchase our first home. While searching for homes, Josh was helpful, patient, and generous with his time. He has a great demeanor for a realtor. He never pushed us to do anything. His demeanor is generally laid back and friendly rather than the pushy car salesman vibes we got from other realtors we met when visiting open houses. Once we decided to make an offer, however, Josh did a great job of pushing our interests during negotiations. As a terrible negotiator myself, I appreciated Josh advocating for us and getting us a great price on our home while still closing the deal in a way that satisfied all parties.

I‚Äôve already recommended Josh to anyone who asks me if I know a good realtor. If you work with Josh to buy or sell your home, I‚Äôm sure you will be happy with the results. He‚Äôs also a warm, enjoyable person to work with and I imagine that we‚Äôll be exchanging Christmas cards in the future."

Eco Movers surpassed each and every one of our expectations. As a law firm, we have an extraordinarily large amount of filing materials, furniture and valuable pieces. When we moved offices, Eco Movers is the sole reason we were able to move seamlessly without interrupting our normal work week. Because of them, all of our projects were able to be completed without disruption.

Simply put: we were able to serve our clients because Eco Movers is so phenomenal at their job. Glenda, the office manager, is one of the kindest and most productive people that we have every worked with.

8311,0.31833333333333336,Phoenix Express did an excellent job moving us from Dallas to Austin. We had to move out of a 4 story townhome with narrow stairways. Our furniture and belongings all arrived to Austin in perfect condition and nothing was found to be broken. They wrapped everything so the furniture didn‚Äôt rub or get scratched. They were also one of the few companies willing to move us in one day and that made it really easy for us. Our piano arrived just as it was in Dallas. The estimate was spot on.

Jeffrey is warm, thorough, proactive and enthusiastic; he guided us through an at times overwhelming and emotional home buying process with great care and expertise. My husband and I began working with Jeffrey not long after giving birth to our daughter; as new parents looking to transition from apartment living to home ownership we could not have found a better agent to help guide us towards the home of our dreams.

Jeffrey was completely understanding and patient with us as we navigated the many steps required to purchase a first home. He is an incredibly communicative person and went above and beyond in getting all parties on the same page, even going so far as to build a relationship with our mortgage lender. He distilled information clearly for us, made himself highly available, and was just a pleasure to work with. He really ""got us"" and what we were looking for, and always made us feel like we were in great, capable hands.

From setting our expectations in the current market to guiding us on how to prepare for the selling of our house. She helped us put in minimal work for maximum profit. She gave great advice on what to clean in our home, helped us get quotes, and managed the property for us while we were across the country. She got work done on the house for us quickly and at a great price. As soon as we moved out, she got work done. She got a pre-inspection, work scheduled post inspection, and our house listed faster than our goal date. From there, she kept us updated about buyers' feedback and open houses. She reviewed offers with us quickly and went WAY above and beyond with going back and forth with the buyers to get us the best offer for our home. We were ready to accept the first offer, but her knowledge of the market and what to push for helped us get an offer beyond our wildest dreams in the current market. Honestly, I thought selling my home would be super stressful and a pain, and she make it effortless. I would highly recommend Lili for buying or selling your home as you can trust her and her team to get you the best possible outcome."

She was always calm, immediately responsive, very honest with me, and really took the time to listen. Christy is the sweetest person and such a hard worker.

11529,0.3171409472880061,"The process of selling and buying at the same time is very stressful and intimidating but thanks to Doron and his team, they made it as easy and flawless as possible!
We initially reached out to Doron in late 2021 and early 2022 as we were thinking of buying and selling at that time but things out of our control happened and we couldn‚Äôt move forward at that time. Doron was never pushy and was always grateful for reaching out to him to help us with this process. He told us he would be ready anytime we are ready to move forward.
We were finally ready at the end of January 2023 and he immediately set up a meeting with us. We told him exactly what we were looking for and he set us up within days with a search to start looking for townhomes. In the meantime, he was coordinating everything else to get our current house on the market. Doron was always very quick to respond to any questions via email, text or call and anytime we sent him a townhome we liked he would immediately set up a home tour.
When we discussed how to price our home, he explained in great detail that we should price it right below the price of new builds in our area so we could get more people interested in coming to see our house. His advice worked so well that we had over 30 showings in just three days and we were able to close on the sale of our house over asking price!
We always felt that Doron had our best interests in mind and if something didn‚Äôt sit right with him when we looked at homes, he would give us his honest opinion and we really liked that. He was not a typical sales person you would find that just wants to make a sale, he genuinely cared and wanted to make sure we were happy every step of the way.
We highly recommend him if you are ever in market to sell, buy or both! You won‚Äôt regret it. We will definitely reach out to Doron again if we are ever in the market in the future."

11806,0.31666666666666665,"Danny is absolutely the best. We‚Äôve now bought and sold a home with him, and he is fantastic from both perspectives. We purchased when the market was super competitive, and he helped us get into our dream neighborhood with a strong and realistic offer. We moved out of state, and sold at a time when the market felt less seller-friendly. Danny made great recommendations and we were able to sell quickly, with multiple offers received. We cannot recommend him enough! Danny always goes above and helped us feel confident both when we purchased and when we sold. He made the entire process seamless and painless. Danny is your best resource whether you‚Äôre looking to sell or buy."

80,0.31666666666666665,My husband and I were shopping around for quotes and this was his first call. He gets a price and then says he‚Äôs going to check with me first. The rep then tells him ‚Äújust tell me it‚Äôs too much. I‚Äôd respect it more if you said that rather than tell me you have to check with your wife over $200.‚Äù He then refuses to give his name. Absolutely unprofessional. I‚Äôll be sure none of our friends or family ever give them business.
3095,0.31666666666666665,"I needed a mover for work.  The ones I contracted refused to do the job.  April was able to get me on the schedule and Ryan & Ross were there to take care of business.   They got my items in quickly and safely.   If I need help again, they will be my first and only call."

They were on time and very manner as they performed their work. And with the amount & size of the stuff I had, they performed without complaining, and I don‚Äôt recall them taking a break.

Thank you for your service!"

Being from out of town and wanting to buy in a super competitive market made our experience a bit stressful and challenging but we managed with Amber's calm, positive help.  She helped us fine tune our focus. She answered lots of questions and provided us with much helpful feedback on properties when we had lists of possibilities. When we wanted to see a property she was always available and would show us the property remotely and revisit it if necessary. She took time to explain issues that we did not understand. Even after closing she has followed up on problematic issues for us. We really appreciated working with Amber and highly recommend her and the Get Happy at Home Team."

He went above and beyond in every step of our home-buying process, from getting to know us and what we wanted, to providing advice, and lender and inspection referrals that made the process easier for us.  He showed us about 40 houses in a span of two weeks, covering most of the Greater Seattle area. He was really open to our schedule and really listened to every comment we made in order to get us our perfect home. He showed a lot of knowledge of the city and its different neighborhoods. Also, he always pointed out advantages and disadvantages from the properties and their locations, which helped us make a more informed decision according to what aligned with our needs and wants.  When we found a place that we loved, he managed to get a pending rental contract rescinded, plus getting us an extension for earnest money, and even some cash back at close!

I can honestly say that Zach made us feel so much more comfortable with our decision and calmed our nerves a TON. He also made it very easy for us...smooth sailing. In addition to just being good at what he does and knowledgeable, he is very down to earth, relatable and great with conversation. We had a lot of good laughs and light-hearted conversations.

I had very specific criteria for a house, and was willing to wait for the right place. I looked at a LOT of houses (mostly with Justin in person, since Covid-19 prevented us from visiting open houses on our own).  Put in probably over 10 offers before finally getting one accepted.

Justin continued nevertheless, responding quickly to  requests, getting things done, providing sound advice, and staying positive throughout the process.

The house I ended up with happened to be the lowest offer I made, and was the exact house I had pictured in my head from the beginning. Very happy with the outcome.

He knows what he's talking about when giving advice and is extremely attentive to clients. Couldn't ask for much more from an agent. Highly recommend!"

Joe and Taylor were very easy to talk to and understanding. They keep their word and tries very hard to stick to the projected closing date. I had a lot of questions being the first time home buyer but Taylor was amazing, getting all my questions answered quickly and accurately.

Another major point about The Every Door Team is their vast off-market home list, you can really strike a good deal."

We hope to be working with him again in the future ^.^"
1185,0.3139069264069264,"Kayla Preston provided excellent service from the beginning of the process and continues to, well after closing. We highly recommend Kayla without any reservations. We sold and bought a home through Kayla and we have nothing, but the most positive things to say about her. She made both processes of buying and selling, from beginning to completion, so very smooth. We loved her professionalism as well as her way of putting us at ease when we entered unfamiliar territory throughout the processes. We never felt rushed nor did we ever feel as though we were stalling, she kept the whole process going like clockwork and without any major hurdles. Kayla always made herself available when we had questions and was very prompt in her replies, this was very important to us. She works extremely hard for her clients and we feel she goes above and beyond really making sure her clients' needs are met. I know we couldn't be happier, very pleased we had Heidi for our realtor and we will recommend her to everyone. Moreover, she is highly attentive to detail, so much so that on several occasions, a buyer‚Äôs agent commented on her eagle eye (e.g., counter height being ADA instead of standard height).  Most important to us, Kayla was always honest with us about what he thought about each property, was always available and helpful, and we always felt that she truly had our best interests at heart. Even now, more than a month after closing, she still cheerfully recommends contractors and other service providers when we contact her looking for suggestions as we complete work on our home. Bottom line ‚Äì I can‚Äôt imagine having a more positive experience and recommend her without reservation to anyone looking to buy in this stressful market.  In the future, if we ever decide to move, we will definitely use Kayla again to both sell our home and find a new one. Thanks Kayla."

8476,0.3135897435897436,"Extraordinary moving experience by a company that not only cares about its customers but also the greater community. One of the biggest reasons (besides a great quote) I signed up with them is because they asked me to give food donations instead of tips for the hungry. It is rare to find a moving company that works hard while thinking about the larger community. Wonderful group of people showed up and did a phenomenal job on the day of the move. Most importantly, they never asked me to write a review like some other movers do. I would recommend them highly."

She was very patient with us as it took a long time for us to decide on the right home due to our budget limitations and preference changes. She made the homefinding journey very joyful for us. Highly recommend her!"

Our baby grand piano was carefully protected, legs removed, and re-assembled beautifully in our new home. They even transported my husband's Studebaker Hawk and made sure it was safe in its new garage. The owners, Jeff, Beau and Angie, were present on moving day to make sure all went well. We used their packers who did an excellent job of wrapping, packing and labeling many boxes. All but a few glass items arrived intact. They gave us a fair price and stuck with it. We would definitely use them again. I highly recommend Phoenix Express's efficient, professional, accommodating team."

My roommates and I tried finding a place on our own through a plethora of random listing websites and felt utterly lost and stuck. We reached out to Jose and Jose immediately took over and catered to all our housing means. We gave him a list of requirements and that very day he sent over listings he trusted and asked for our opinion on them. We found a property we liked and Jose THAT DAY went over and toured the place sending photos and videos. Talk about dedication. He is an honest worker and took care of all the lease agreements and property set up. If you have the opportunity, go to Jose for all your housing needs."

It was no different on this occasion. There was one thing that stood out as ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù and that was how many stairs the movers had to go up to get to the house. They had an ingenious work-around.. they adjusted their ramp to go straight across, which halved the number of steps."

When we started the process of buying our first home, it seemed a bit mind boggling- lots of paperwork and, OH YEAH, preparing to sign away all the money we've ever made. My husband and I immediately felt comfortable with Danny. We had a few hiccups with getting all the right financial documents in order and Danny was extremely patient and walked us through each step. He connected us with an awesome mortgage broker and it was super helpful to work with a realtor and mortgage broker who have worked together before- they talked about our situation regularly and everyone was always on the same page- no surprises. Talking to other couples about their home buying experience, ours was quite easy, despite our private contractor sallaries. Danny made it painless, he listened to our needs, was extremely responsive throughout the entire process and we were so happy to have him there with us the first time we opened the door to our home.

After we'd already moved in, I asked him for some recommendations for a professional painter and he was happy to help. While many realtors complete the sale and say 'see ya later', I know we can continue to rely on Danny as a valuable resource for all things house-related.   Danny looks out for his client's best interest. If you're on the fence about whether or not you should/ can buy, start a conversation with him.

I will continue to recommend him to friends over and over again."

From day one, Chavi took the time to learn about our needs and advise us about what we could reasonably afford. We worked with Chavi and Roy to see countless homes, and were deeply impressed with their work ethic and flexibility. The whole team is professional, personable, and knowledgeable. Roy and Chavi are amazing people who deeply care about their clients (no matter the budget!). Even after all the paperwork was signed and we‚Äôd moved in, Roy dropped by to fix our thermostat. And the thoughtful gestures haven‚Äôt stopped there (thank you Roy, Chavi, and Kim!).  We love our home, and are so glad we picked the Divas to help get us there."

They purchased the house as-is, which was incredibly convenient given its need for significant repairs. They made the process even easier by not requiring us to empty out the house, handling everything with care and consideration. The offer was fair, with no hidden fees, and the entire transaction was transparent and stress-free. I highly recommend Eric and his team for their professionalism, compassion, and efficiency."

10/10 recommend Eco Movers!

Also, I was over confident in how well we prepped our place so I thought our hours-estimate was grossly wrong. Turns out, they were right.

Tip for anyone moving, fill out your inventory sheet to the best of your ability because their estimate for the # of hours they'll need is pretty spot on!"

11503,0.3116984126984127,"I met Kelly by complete happenstance. I was touring a property where he was the listing broker and he gave me his card since I didn't have an agent. That proved to be one of the best chance encounters I've ever had! Kelly was super knowledgeable of the Seattle housing market, very diligent, timely, and responsive. His upbeat attitude kept our spirits high, even as the sellers-market made it increasingly difficult to get an offer accepted. He maintained that we would eventually find our perfect property... and he was right! The place we ended up buying was our favorite yet! After our offer was accepted, Kelly went above and beyond to ensure closing was as smooth as possible. I'd love for all my future real-estate transactions to be brokered by Kelly.

Tod was patient, he responded promptly and professionally.  He was great with negotiations with the other realtor.  It was because of him that everything went so smoothly.  He has a very informative interactive website.  The pictures he took of our home were very professional.  Everything was top quality.  I consider myself a picky consumer and I have no complaints at all.  I would recommend him to families and friends."

We had a long cross country move from CA to Miami to coordinate, and we needed to find a place within a specific timeframe. I reached out to Henrique a month or so prior, and he immediately set up a search with apartments based on our budget, size and location preference. While we were traveling, he reached out to our favorite listings to set up viewings for literally the morning after we arrived to Miami. From there, he helped with the entire rental process, including reviewing our contract and requesting edits that were in our best interest. He was available constantly to answer questions, and it really felt like we had a friend who wanted what was best for us.

The crew was fantastic, hard working, polite and very professional, I couldn't ask for anything better. And one of the sore points of any move was eliminated. There were no arguments about the cost. I knew ahead of time what the TOTAL cost will be. So much per hour, including the truck. The time starts when the movers reach the place and ends when the move is done. Being in the service business myself, I appreciate all that I experienced with Power Load. I hope that they keep it up. Not too many movers like this."

Trelora only charges for the actual services needed during home buying/selling process and keep their customer's pocket happy.

Working with team Trelora (Chris, Rod, Blake and others) was a great experience. They were always available, very responsive, meticulous, thorough, always gave neutral advice and never pressurized to finalize on a home just to get a deal going. They even worked on weekend to make sure I do not miss on the offer. I cannot thank them enough. Team Trelora is just awesome.

11301,0.3089902597402598,"We were searching for a new home in Seattle while we were up in the area for a week.  Kelly was the listing agent for a new construction property in Ballard that we visited.  We were interested in one of the units at his property but wanted to look around as we didn't know the area very well.  Rather than just be content with our visit to his property, Kelly went above and beyond to help us search the area and get to know Seattle.  He searched for listings that met our criteria, personally took us around multiple properties in the area and helped us put an offer on the one we initially liked the most.  After helping us through the negotiation, we decided instead to go back and purchase the original property he showed us.

That willingness to help us understand the area and be open to our preferences was what was great about working with Kelly.  He's someone that you can trust to help you through the process of finding a great home, will ensure you have all the relevant information to make the right decision and will get you the best deal available.  I would highly recommend working with him to sell your home or buy a new one."
8799,0.30894660894660897,"Being first time home buyers, it was important we partnered with an expert who was informative, patient and skilled in negotiation.  We found just that person with Geoff Hill.  Geoff had all the right expertise to close our transaction within a span of 4 weeks (fast!).

Several striking qualities that Geoff possess include:

1. Honesty.  Geoff is here for you, he‚Äôs on your team.  We toured a home that looked promising, until Geoff pointed out some peculiar aspects of the neighboring home that lead to our decision to pass on the property.  It goes to say, ‚Äúyou can switch homes but you can‚Äôt switch your neighbors.‚Äù
2. Patience.  Geoff respects the autonomy of his clients and never once told us ‚Äúyou should buy this home.‚Äù  Our decision to put an offer down was made after many informed discussions with Geoff, by us.
3. Negotiation skills: Geoff has a knack for this stuff and knows when to play hardball versus harmonious.  He digs deep for the discounts pre and post inspection, which landed us close to $10,000 discount all while staying reasonable and appealing to the sellers.  In addition, his expertise in fine combing through contract terms was a great benefit.  We probably went through 10+ addendums to the contract but all worth it from a buyers perspective to ensure we got the best deal.

Overall, the entire experience was smooth,  fast and informative, all things first time homebuyers should look for."

Kim came highly recommended from a workmate, and we met with her and her business partner Chavi Hohm at a coffee shop in the area where we were looking to buy. They put us at our ease almost immediately, but were also very open and honest about what we might find. When we found what we were looking for, they were able to deftly take us through the process of signing (an experience new to both of us) and, on numerous occasions, kept us from freaking out. They have since become great resources for us new homeowners, with recommendations for everything from reasonably-priced handy-men to the best place to buy local wines. I simply can't say enough good about how well our home-buying process was handled."

10451,0.3085218463706836,"Rob was a big help selling our house.  In fact, a great help!  He was patient, knowledgeable and completely up front about the whole process and what to expect.  And then he delivered.
We called Rob as we were tossing the idea around of selling.  His input was instrumental in organizing our thoughts, planning the process, and working with our tenants to get the house ready and looking sharp.  His market research was well done and he took the time to walk us through his thinking while developing our best strategy.  He took some fantastic photos and really put the property's best foot forward.
We listed and the property immediately shot up in number of people looking and becoming a Hot Home, with much credit to Rob's thoughtful presentation and images.  We attracted great potential buyers and Rob handled all of their questions and concerns with professionalism and a straight forward condor that was much appreciated.  In fact we heard later from one that they very much appreciated working with Rob - even thought they were not the winning offer.  We liked to hear that Rob, acting as our representative, was making a positive impression in what is typically not an enjoyable process.
The offers came in and Rob has a very well organized process and review chart that was a great help for us to understand the nuances of each offer.  With this help, we narrowed to our top offers and worked with each of them in a very fair way to determine a winning offer.
Rob handled all of the final details and has a great escrow team that made the signing very convenient and easy.
In the end, it took less time, sold for more, and was a much better experience than other real estate transactions we have been involved with in the past.  Would we recommend Rob to anyone looking to sell, or buy, a house?  Absolutely and emphatically!!"

Our house sold quickly for an amount that we were very happy with. I highly recommend working with Doron."

11431,0.30832953596111495,"Trying to find a home in the Seattle area is extremely challenging.  Get Happy at Home team was a key factor in navigating our first home purchase.

We first started looking a few years ago and even then Matt was tireless in helping us find something we liked which also met our budget.  In addition, he was more than willing to navigate any challenges which may surface as we were using the VA loan process including finding a loan officer we could work with that had expertise in VA loans.  Timing turned out to be not quite right so we shelved the idea of purchasing a home.

Fast forward a couple of years later and on a whim we went and looked at a new build.  We really liked it but wanted a professional opinion before we proceeded.  We contacted Matt once again to get his input before going any further.  Not only did Matt give us his professional take on the situation, he did a full fledged deep dive inquiry including an entire report and provided a list of properties we should look at before making any final decisions.

By the following weekend we were out looking at all the comparable properties Get Happy at Home found so we could make an informed purchasing decision.  Matt and Ian were tireless in showing us all the options and gave us their unbiased professional feedback on any question we asked.  They were fierce negotiators when it came to settling the contract with the builder.  Matt and Ian were able to get us an even better deal than we first came to the table with.  More importantly, they were able to negotiate down our purchase price after the builder lowered comparable lots post contract signing.

Their expertise and guidance was invaluable all the way through the process and on closing day the Get Happy at Home team came out to celebrate with us!  We could not be more pleased with the Get Happy at Home Team.  The team's responsiveness, professionalism, and advocacy on your behalf as a buyer is invaluable.  I cannot recommend Get Happy at Home enough to anyone looking to buy a home!"
10987,0.3082142857142857,"Amazing experience with Poliana Coelho! She was a detail oriented person, very careful and patient during the rental process, helping us with all rental documents. My husband and I chose the apartment in Miami by photos because we were in another country. When we arrived at the place the apartment looked like exactly as in the photos. In addition, Poliana was present during all the inspection process, always very friendly. I recommend with great enthusiasm the Miami Realty Solution, especially the realtor Poliana Coelho."
1085,0.3080729166666667,"Angel and Kel were amazing at moving me into my apartment on the third floor. They worked so hard and were so polite and professional!! All my furniture, boxes and tubs were handled with such great care!
I would definitely hire them again!! They are the BEST!!! Thank you Kel and Angel!!"
3694,0.308,Very knowledgeable about the D/FW real estate market.  Very honest and gives ample feedback on property and selling process.  Always ready to take a question or concern that may come up.  Highly recommend working with Tod at DFWCityhomes if you are buying or selling properties.
11276,0.30778425655976677,"The short version is that we would strongly recommend Matt, Ian, and the GHAH team to anyone looking to buy or sell a house. They found us the perfect home and saved us $45,000 during the offer process. We would also recommend them to anyone wanting to get any repair/improvement work done on their house or property. They are amazing and we can‚Äôt say enough great things about them!

The longer version: We went through Matt and Ian to buy our home. They were highly recommended to us by an acquaintance so we decided to reach out to them. They cleared 2 hours to meet with us so we would have plenty of time to ask them whatever we wanted about their experience and tell them what we were looking for in real estate agents and in our future home. Instantly we liked the combination of their knowledge of the market, their fun and positive energy, and their transparency about what it was like to be a buyer in the greater Seattle/Eastside market. We went on several showings with them to start and appreciated their ability to point out pros and cons about each house and neighborhood we visited. As first time home buyers it was easy for us to overlook red flags when we saw a house or neighborhood we liked. The showings were very informative and we also had a ton of fun together which made the process much more enjoyable.

After a month or so, we found a home we loved and wanted to put an offer on. Matt and Ian talked us through what the process was to submit an offer and worked late into the evening to put it together for us so it could be submitted by the offer deadline. The next day, before we had a response, they warned us about the tactics some unscrupulous listing agents use to try to push buyers to their max offer price without competing offers. Lo and behold, the listing agent did do that. Matt and Ian helped us feel comfortable standing firm at the offer price the actual competing offer would push our escalating offer price to, and also talked us through ways to tweak our offer without increasing the offer price more than a competing offer would push our escalator. We won the house and thanks to Matt and Ian we were able to save $45,000 by holding out from just moving to our max offer price right away.

After we won the offer Matt, Ian, and Marquesa helped us through the escrow process the whole time, made sure we hit our scheduled dates, did the final walkthrough with us, and got us our keys right after we officially closed.

GHAH also has a contracting arm. We have used them to install new fencing/gates, a utility sink in our laundry room that required plumbing in the wall and re-drywalling, and new carpet. Brian and Medardo are both great to work with and their crews have all been excellent.

We also had flooding in our basement after a week of intense rain that followed a week of snow. GHAH, Medardo and his crew were out that day to help us suck up the water, mitigate the damage, and determine the cause. Brian even rented equipment for us from Home Depot to dry out the rooms after they sucked out the water. GHAH was not only able to refer us to a water damage repair company to assess any damage, but they were also able to refer us to a drainage contractor to analyze our yard and implement a solution to prevent this from happening again.

We‚Äôve had nothing but great experiences with all members of the GHAH team."

I was on a budget and looking for a fixer, and Celia was able to offer great advice about what kinds of issues I'd be able to tackle and what would be too much.

As I was shopping for a real estate agent, what was striking about Danny was his buyer-friendly approach and timely follow-ups. As we started out he was full of good market insights, stayed highly responsive with feedback, scheduling and touring and educated me many times about the homebuying process. What I most appreciated was his role at the time of making offers. He was firm with his advice on offer terms, realistic with feedback and never pushed me to make an offer that I'd be nervous about.

5032,0.3057178932178932,"If I could give them 6 stars, I would. From start to finish, I had a wonderful experience and the company has made things so easy for me. Initially I hired ManCav because j remembered that ManCav delivered my furniture from Modani when I moved into my apartment 6 years ago. So I returned to them because they are familiar with my specific furniture and wanted to ensure it could be taken disassembled and reassembled efficiently AND properly.

Angelica is AMAZING at following up and following through. Everything was executed just as she told me to expect it.

I hired ManCav to pack my apartment on one day, and to have movers move it all the next day.

For packing, Odalys, Mari, and B√°rbara came and wrapped and packed all of my things. When I reached my new home they had packed so well that everything made it unharmed and in great condition. It took 5 hours and they worked diligently and were wonderfully friendly. So much so that I hired Odalys to clean the apartment I was leaving post move before I return the keys to the owner.

For the move, I had Steve, Miguel, and Guillermo and they were FAST and organized. They were also super cool and easy to talk to and receptive to special requests and directions with some of the items. Again, it took about 5 hours to load things and about 2 hours to unload and get things set up in the new home. All of my furniture made it in perfect condition, including a Peloton which they wrapped with very well and moved with care.

I have to drive a U-Haul from TX to move more things into the home next week, and I‚Äôve already hired this same team of guys to unload the U-Haul when I arrive back at home.

The rates at ManCav are straightforward and the value is great! I will suggest them to others and return to them the next time I need to move. 10 out of 10!"

We had already moved out of the area when it came time to list and the team was fantastic at helping to coordinate on the ground! The house was staged beautifully, they put lovely cards and notes throughout the house calling out all our updates and little things that we loved about it. Ultimately got an offer at list price within a few weeks of listing in a slowing market with increasing interest rates and we were so happy to have trusted partners throughout the process with the Bushwick team!"

What I really appreciate is their 1hr minimum during the week.  Other movers require 3 hrs min (on weekdays), which is completely unnecessary for some moves.

Meeting Ron was a breath of fresh air in what feels like a congested market. Real estate is a team effort, and Ron is a crucial teammate for his enthusiasm and ability to connect genuinely with everyone involved in your deal. You want him and his reconnaissance on your team. His passion and encouragement, with excellent communication makes the entire process feel possible. He cares about your vision, and advocates for your intentions. To spend time with your real estate agent, it's an added bonus that Ron is an interesting conversationalist and honest.

11402,0.3047619047619048,"Team Diva was a delight to work with. We primarily worked with Chavi, Roy and Kim and also had the pleasure of meeting the broader team. Not only is Team Diva super savvy about the market, they took the time to really understand not just what we were looking for but why we were prioritizing certain features. This meant they were able to show us tailored options including some unexpected places we never would have thought to look at. Buying a house is a stressful time, but the Divas made it as painless as it can be. From considering neighborhoods to advising on our offer strategy, they were amazing partners through the whole process. I'm so glad that a friend referred us to them, and I've already told a number of people that if they need to buy or sell, they should look to Team Diva."

Josh, Jesse and Eric were all considerate and careful throughout the day."

9044,0.3046875,"Zach is unique in a great way. I've worked with 2 real estate agents in the past with mixed results. Zach in comparison was available to answer questions throughout the process and I never felt I was on the back-burner. End result, I got a better deal than what I expected b/c of him.

I'm not a fan of agents that sound more like sales trying to convince you a house is nice. Instead, Zach would let me draw my own conclusions about a property and be upfront when he thought something may be 'off'. Most important of all, it was his negotiating skills combined with his scheduling bids on needed work on the house that got me a good deal. You won't be disappointed when you choose to work with him."

Ricky and his crew were very professional and friendly, non stop working through heat and humidity, and they really treated our belongings like it were theirs.

5871,0.3044938016528926,"The individuals from Eco movers were amazing. They were the nicest and most professional people ever.  I am just so thankful because honestly, I really didnt feel like moving all that stuff. It isn't that I couldn't do it. Nor was I trying to flex wealth, but it honestly took a just a little bit of stress off of me.  In the world we live in now, just even a little bit of piece of mind can be helpful.  I know that I could have asked a friend, but why put them at risk?  Oh speaking of Covid-19 they were all masked up and just perfect y'all, like they really made this an amazing experience. ANOTHER MOVING COMPANY REFERRED ME TO ECO MOVERS DURING A QUOTE. I mean, it doesnt get much more awesome than that.  So thank you and I am so sorry I do not remember everyones name, but I remember your energy and your spirit. When I move again, but hopefully not anytime soon because I love these hardwood floors and when I move again I will absolutely be calling them.  I will suggest them to everyone I know. I might even name drop on my youtube channel, but probably not yet because I am not famous enough.  But one day, I will be and when I am and one of my viewers happens to be a resident in the Seattle area who is also looking to move? I will then say your name and it will be awesome.  Ok, well I am going to stop procrastinating now, which is what I would have done with the move if I would have done it myself.  Lol...Thanks everyone.  See you when I get famous.

11040,0.3044397759103642,"We had a wonderful experience working with Marc at WaLaw buying our home in Brier. If you're comfortable using the internet to find houses to look at, WaLaw is the way to go.

Other reviewers have noted the pricing structure - you need to be really sure you are going to buy, since you pay some money upfront to prove you are serious. Also, don't expect them to do all the legwork for you - you need to find houses you like and ask to see them. Going to lots of open houses helps too (that's how we found the house we ended up choosing).

With our first house, we used a conventional real-estate agent, which was fine, but we ended up finding the house we wanted without that agent's help. Really all we needed was someone to let us in for tours, and someone to do the heavy lifting when it comes time for all the paperwork. If that's all YOU need, you should check out WaLaw.

With our second house, we were going to use Redfin, but my friend who used WaLaw to purchase his house recommended that we check them out. I'm so glad we did!

On the paperwork side, WaLaw is absolutely ideal, because they are lawyers too! They aren't just pushing papers around that somebody else wrote - they can make changes on your behalf, and they can explain things to you as a lawyer.

Marc and Claire were great from start to finish. I would highly recommend them to anybody. Plus, you save money - even more than you would save by using Redfin!

They are more pleasant, professional and efficient then you‚Äôll find in many of the  snooty ‚ÄúBoutique Brokerages‚Äù.  Richr‚Äôs business model of keeping the $$ in the hand of the buyers and sellers is putting an end to the old saying ‚ÄúThe only person NOT broke after a Real Estate Transaction is the Broker‚Äù!"
2026,0.3042929292929293,"Kyle and the crew at Easy Company Moving were great from beginning to end. Communication with Kyle was very good - easy, straightforward and very clear with getting the quote and then scheduling Easy Company for my move in July. Luis and Haku arrived a few minutes early and also called about 25-30 minutes ahead of their arrival time to confirm they were on their way and provide ETA on their arrival for the beginning of the move. The truck and equipment used is good, professional and they are very prepared (e.g. various hand trucks, lots of moving blankets, boxes to help with moving, etc.). Communication with both Luis and Haku was very good throughout the moving process and they followed instructions on what needed to be moved to specific locations as requested, they handled our moved items well (regular and fragile items were all handled with good care), items that needed to be wrapped with blankets or strapped into the truck so it wouldn't move around was done very well. The estimate and final moving costs matched up as quoted (no unexpected surprise charges and only good professional work from Luis and Haku). I recommend Easy Company Moving and their crew (Kyle, Luis, and Haku) for anyone looking for good local quality movers. They charge a fair competitive price for good work. Will definitely look to use Easy Company Moving next time I need professional movers for my moving needs."

From building our quote to giving tips on preparing for the move, and then to the entire team on moving day. Alejandro, Jaleel, Lorenzo, and Kyle were not only quick and efficient, but they blew me away with their professionalism and level of respect, not just for me as the customer, but particularly¬†to one another throughout the entire process. These young men demonstrated excellent communication and teamwork throughout the entire move. It was incredibly impressive to watch. Easy Company moving made a traditionally very stressful process a breeze, and affordable. Thank you, and I will be reaching back out to schedule our move from our temporary house as well in the coming months.¬†Highly recommend!"

Doron is also very knowledgeable about both the areas in Seattle - who knew there were so many neighborhoods? - but also for the details of the home itself, like its build quality and how we may modify it in the future. He was also respectable to our needs and budget. We highly recommend Doron, and will use him again for our future home!"

As first time home buyers, we really had no idea of what the process would look like but Justin made sure we were well taken care of every step of the way.

We never felt rushed or pushed in one direction or another and this truly made our experience with Justin and Wagner Real Estate top notch!"

11483,0.3037878787878788,"We enthusiastically recommend WaLaw.  We initially chose WaLaw solely  because of the lower fee structure compared to other realtors, but we were very happily surprised by the great advice we got from Marc.  On home tours, he was quite knowledgeable about details of construction and comparative market value of property.  He was very analytical and gave us much more detail than we were used to hearing from realtors.

Once we selected a property, Marc worked effectively and efficiently to submit a strong offer.  Having a lawyer working on our behalf increased our confidence during the purchasing process.  Marc and Claire were responsive and helpful every step of the way.  In the end, we got a much nicer house than we hoped, for less money than we planned to spend.  WaLaw provided great value at an affordable price."

He shared relevant houses with us shortly after they came on the market. He was quick to tour homes with us when we found some we liked. He helped us craft an offer that worked for us.

We would work with Rob again for another real estate transaction, if/when we have one. We've already referred Rob to another friend. We recommend him."
7147,0.30370370370370364,"Sopiko is simply the best. After spending months trying to find a place to buy and getting nowhere with other realtors, I decided to give up and look for a rental. Sopiko happened to be the agent to show us. I was impressed and enjoyed her genuinely nice personality and knowledge so much that I asked if she‚Äôd help me look for a place to buy instead. She listened to everything I asked from the location, price range, specific features to comps. She delivered immediately on any property I was interested in and always checked in and kept me posted. Within a month I was under contract. I honestly can‚Äôt say enough about how amazing and fun  and seem less my experience was with Sopiko. From negotiating the price to  or just recommending several title companies and insurance companies, but also, finding the prices for me as well! I have bought and sold a good number of homes and it‚Äôs so rare to find a realtor that works hard and is truly on your side to help you achieve your goals."

They even helped us to accommodate  furniture on our new house, moving and re-arranging furniture as we were deciding on the best placement.

It started on 2010 when we almost gave up on looking for a house we liked within our budget. Two weeks after meeting Doron he found us the perfect house.

Our experience with Doron was nothing short than amazing. Highly recommended!"
10786,0.3034313725490196,"I don‚Äôt even know where to begin. Describing Geoff as sharp, responsive, professional, compassionate, and invaluable would be unequivocally true, but only begins to scratch the surface of the value he brings to the table. For the two years we worked together, he had my best interests at heart every step of the way and worked tirelessly to help my finance and I find and close on our dream home. Geoff acts as an advisor and I never once felt pressured by him to pull the trigger, despite our extended search. If anything, he was the reasoned voice in the room telling me that I could do better and should wait for the perfect opportunity.

A few more highlights you can expect when working with him: multiple remote GoPro video walkthroughs while out of state; access to his amazing network of local Seattle vendors from loans to insurance to 3d blueprinting; deep insight into the tumultuous Seattle real estate market; and measured, tactical guidance when it comes to making an offer and negotiating terms.

If you have the opportunity to work with Geoff, consider yourself extremely lucky to have found the best in class."

He always took the time to explain the process and answer every single question we had. Was always personable, thoughtful, courteous, and advised us prudently throughout. You can tell he really cared about us making a good deal that made sense. More importantly, during negotiations he fought for us every step of the way.

10740,0.30327380952380956,"THE. MOST. AMAZING. TEAM. Seriously, my husband and I are forever indebted to Amber and the rest of the team for helping us navigate the housing market in this crazy time. Everything was one thousand times above & beyond, from the very first ""learning"" meeting, neighborhood tours, endless phone calls and txt messages, and then coaching us through our first (& only!) offer on our perfect home.

Amber was there for us in a million ways, answering our calls, and questions at all hours. We were educated, advocated for, and so taken care of. If it wasn't for Amber's knowledge, direction and insight, we may have put more offers out there or settled for something we liked but didn't love. But Amber helped us create our non-negotiables, filter our search, tour EVERYTHING, be picky, and wait to put an offer in until we were completely sold. They drafted us a winning offer, the process was extremely efficient, and Amber even helped connect us with resources for our home renovations after closing!

These people are brilliant, tireless, and honestly super fun! Being around Amber, Matt, & Ian is always a party, and we can't imagine working with anyone else. They are the very very very best."

She has an incredible knowledge of the market and she is very good at using data to help us understand the market and the pricing of the home. She provided us a very detailed value report before we put an offer on the house. That made us very confident in our decision.
Lili helped us put together an offer that got us our home in a multiple offer situation (7 other offers and we were not the highest bid!).  She engaged with the seller's agent very closely to help maximize our chances of success. Her experience and reputation with the other agents were absolutely critical to our success. She also shared with us some very useful and smart strategies in putting a competitive offer.  She is definitely a sharp negotiator. She is also very good at communication and super patient with us.

8439,0.3023148148148148,"Best move we ever made...out of 4 other moves.  We were in a rush to get moved...buyers required a 30 day close.  Beau came over on a Saturday for the quote to move to Tulsa...instantly related to him.  The move was so efficient, packers and loaders all worked constantly until done...wrapping everything in blankets, bubble wrap and shrink wrap.  Absolutely nothing damaged (that never happened before these guys).  Packed up and out so quick, I thought they had to have missed something.  But no...all was there and I can't thank them enough.  Incredible job Jeff and Beau and team!!  Very grateful!!  Ken"

11197,0.30210884353741496,"Sharon Ashlaya is simply the best! She listened to everything I had to say and put a lot of thought into picking out apartments that fit my criteria. I was stressed about my tight timeline and moving from abroad, but Sharon made the process fun, easy, and efficient. Highly recommend."

2490,0.3020833333333333,I used Exodus Moving last minute yesterday and I had to write regarding my experience.  I never used a moving company before and I will always use Exodus Moving. The crew sent out were the most hard working and polite guys I have ever met.  If you are moving call Exodus and ask for Mamberto's crew they were great!!
5194,0.3020833333333333,"JC and Andrew were excellent! They were on time, worked hard and always took the extra step to be sure they met our needs."
4383,0.3020714285714286,"We recently moved from Seattle to Bellevue, and decided to go with Pure Moving after reading their great reviews. Mura and Zack notified me of their ETA, arrived on time, and were extremely efficient in packing, loading and moving our stuff. They took special care with heavy items and large furniture. I am very impressed with their service and would highly recommend this amazing team."
471,0.30205128205128207,"Further to my review below from two months ago, the owner Kyle C and Alejandro drove for more than an hour from Seattle to help re-position the pedestal of my dining table without extra charge, which is so kind for them to do.  You can count on this company for a stress-free moving experience.  They are priced very reasonably too after comparing several quotes. Highly recommend!

We're so happy to have found Easy Company Moving.  Kyle C., the owner, not only gave us a quote by email but also came to our home for a more accurate estimate.  The actual cost is pretty close to the estimate.  The price is reasonable compared with other moving companies.  It costs us only $15 to have the crew applied felt pads to all of our furniture on wood floor.  We really appreciate the crew on the day of our move - Eli, Luis, Dontae, Alejandro and Kyle H.  These guys move fast and strong too!  Really nice team and kind.  Shout out to Dontae for paying attention to details, he'd remind us to plug in the extension cords before he pushed the furniture against the wall because he remembered how it was assembled at the old home.  It's the best move we could ask for and we highly recommend Easy Company Moving."
10580,0.3018333333333334,"David was a great realtor to work with! He was on time, efficient, knowledgeable and always happy to answer any questions i had!

Will definitely use David again when the time comes!"
11589,0.3016666666666667,"I highly recommend Sage Newman and LacMont Realty when purchasing a residential or commercial property.  Sage knows the Seattle market and the surrounding areas better than anyone I have met.  Whenever I need insight on the Seattle market, he is the first person I contact.  There couldn't be another person who will work harder for his clients and have the best information about the markets than Sage."

So look no further than Pure Moving when it's time to move. You won't regret it. Plus, it doesn't hurt that these guys are kind of cute.

Five Stars all the way. !!"
2644,0.30156862745098045,"Our experience with Wildcat Movers was outstanding from start to finish! They have made an involved move so much easier. Daniel M. did an excellent job explaining their process and provided a detailed estimate. We had a date change due to a delayed closing date, and Daniel worked smoothly to adjust our packing date.

Our packers, Christian and Deshun, were excellent, 5-star packers. They arrived on time, were super professional, worked closely with us about how to pack up the moving pod, and carefully handled, padded, and wrapped our more delicate furniture. They clearly were master packers. They made this part of our move so smooth and easy. We would highly recommend Wildcat Movers. üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü"

They were on time, called on the way, and were quick and careful with all our furniture. Lloyd and Kieton were very respectful. They asked us where we wanted everything in the new apartment and were happy to rearrange things the couple of times that we changed our minds. I highly recommend Wildcat Movers for your next relocation they did a wonderful job!"
164,0.30142045454545446,Fast friendly and accommodating. We unexpectedly moved after placing the order and they gladly held off delivery until we moved into our new place. I appreciated the heads up phone call that they were on their way giving us a more accurate delivery time frame.  Delivery staff were polite and efficient.
2577,0.3013888888888889,They were very friendly and worked quickly and efficiently! Whenever I move again I will definitely be using this company again!!!

They arrived on time, assessed the situation and moved everything in an extremely careful, efficient and timely fashion. They were punctual, professional and handled everything including the smallest items with utmost care. We couldn't be more pleased with their service and would highly recommend their services for a smooth and reliable moving experience."
4719,0.3011111111111111,This is by far the best moving company in Seattle! I have moved quite a lot and have never experienced such professional and kind service. Kyle and Ed were on time and even took my unwanted stuff to the dump for me! I would highly recommend using this locally owned and managed company if you want the best! Thank you Kyle and Ed!
5162,0.3010450487012987,"You get what you pay for in the best way. Pure Moving is on the expensive side, but it's because the service and people provide the best customer service. Zach and his crew were great. I was so worried about our move because we live on a busy street with narrow driveway. We also ended up being in a rush in our move and didn't clean everything before the move. The movers still handled everything with care, and even fixed some things. I felt comfortable leaving the group alone to take care of everything, as I cleaned the place. They also let us know of any issues with our furniture that we didn't notice. And throughout the whole process they were professional, with one person even being the sweetest guy, smiling, waving and offering a helping hand. These guys are incredibly strong, and surpassingly helpful with interior design.

When companies are raising the price and removing their services now a days, it feels like you can get rip off. Not Pure Movers! They are still proving the great service we all wish for."
1022,0.30104166666666665,I Highly recommend Megan Norris! She‚Äôs very professional and responded in a timely matter. Which I appreciate! Thank you Megan! :)
11548,0.30092592592592593,"Richr was great for my real estate sale, which was a South Beach condo.  they allowed me to save all the money, 100%, for the seller agent commission, which was over $11,000 assuming 3%, and i saved another $3700 by offering a 2% buyer agent commission (rather than standard 3%).  so Richr saved me almost $15,000 !  i strongly recommend Richr to anyone selling their home.  i believe the key benefit that a seller agent offers is the MLS listing, and Richr provides that without the seller agent commission. Richr has a great business model that provides a significant financial return to anyone selling their home."

9817,0.30078125,"I just moved from Dallas back to the Philly suburbs where I am originally from. I was not sure about using the service that had been provided for me to move there almost 5 years ago. I went on Yelp and found Phoenix Express and from the moment I spoke with Jeff I knew I was in good hands. He and his wife Angie run such an amazing and organized moving service. They helped come box me up, moved my belongings out in a timely way, and were even able to accommodate a later delivery to Pennsylvania based on my schedule. Their timing of everything happened exactly when they said it would and their communication was great. I could not be happier with their service and I would recommend them to anyone looking for a long distance moving company in Dallas. I love that they are family owned and they really take pride in what they do. They're also so friendly!!"
3136,0.3007575757575758,"I can't say enough great things about Wildcat Movers! They said they'd be there between 8:00-8:30 and I got a call at 7:55 saying they were 5 minutes away. We had some trouble deciding where to put the truck but they didn't start their timer for my move until they got inside and picked up the first box. They were so friendly and nice but never once stopped working. Antonyo & Demetrius were kind and easy to work with, they put every piece of furniture in whatever room I wanted it and never complained about anything (even moving things from the third floor). They quoted me that it would take up to 4.5 hours and they had it completely done in 3 hours. You will NOT regret hiring them."
4777,0.30068027210884357,"I booked wildcat movers after reading the online reviews. The process was easy and thorough. The morning of the move, Ricky and Gamez were the movers.

Even though they showed up at the end of my expected timeframe, they called prior to let me know they were on the show. They were extremely courteous and took care of my items. The best part was they were FAST and AFFORDABLE! I moved from an apartment to a house about 30 minutes away. I thought the price was too good to be true. I will continue to recommend them to all my family and friends, and be sure to use them again for any future moves."

David was a great help.  We started talking about selling the house 7 months ago while renting the property.  David kept in touch and when the renters moved out, we texted David, met with the inspector, agreed on a fair price and closed the deal.

The closing process was easy. An independent notary came to our home and handled the document signing and funding was completed in 48 hours,

I would recommend talking to David if you have a home to sell and want a quick closing.

Johnine has extensive experience in the real estate industry and her expertise shone through every stage of home buying.

Tonya‚Äôs communication skills are exceptional ‚Äì she kept us informed throughout the process, promptly answering all our questions, and addressing all the concerns we had.

Britney, deserves to be recognized for her exceptional dedication to her clients. The home buying process is stressful enough but when you have someone who cares, takes the time to build a relationship with all the family members, and is there every step of the way then you get to enjoy the experience.
Britney went above and beyond to meet our expectations for our new home. She was thorough in her searches for homes, even within the box we wanted to be in, and she searched for the best financing options; she did it all.
We can not only say that we found a realtor but we found a friend. Britney's wonderful personality and drive will deliver the results for her clients.

He prepared a detailed assessment of comparable properties in the area and worked diligently to help us set the right listing price.

He was very involved throughout the sales process, checking in with us frequently and going the distance in terms of communication with buyer's agents.

We couldn't be more pleased with the relationship we developed with Rob, and of course we're very pleased with the outcome of our sale!"

When our offer was accepted, he worked   tirelessly to ensure the best deal possible for us. In addition to all his hard work and effort, he was an inexhaustible resource of details great and small about all aspects of home ownership, remodeling, and repair; we're extremely grateful for the abundance of remodeling referrals he gave us. His infectious enthusiasm was one of our favorite parts of the whole experience and we'll miss our daily updates from him.

They did not let a minute go to waste which was not an easy request considering we lived on the third floor (no elevator). With Taylor's experience and Joshua's wingspan, we were able to knock this out in three hours.

6808,0.2994819223985891,"We are so grateful we got to work with Peter Duncan from Every Door Real Estate to purchase our very first home!  My fianc√© and I were both first time home-buyers in this unprecedented market and it was Peter‚Äôs expertise, local connections, and wonderful personality that made the process a pleasant one from start to finish. We started out without much knowledge about the housing market or the home-buying process, but Peter helped us navigate it by asking the right questions, understanding our needs, and providing solid information based on his own knowledge as well as market analysis. At one point, the bidding war on a particular house got so intense that we were close to winning but only if we went above our own budget. At that point, the house was already way over asking price and we had to make the decision quickly‚Ä¶ we started to panic and asked for Peter‚Äôs advice, and he actually advised us not to overpay for something that is above our budget, and advised us to keep looking. That will always stick with us - he could have easily persuade us to overpay and walked away with a significantly larger commission‚Ä¶ but no. He did what he felt was the right thing to do. We appreciated this so much, especially because we found our dream home shortly after that for a much better price (which he found for us, of course)! I have already started recommending Peter to my family and close friends because I trust that he will take great care of them and help them find their dream home, too."
11126,0.2994791666666667,"Danny was a great agent to work with, would happily work with him again. He was knowledgeable, informed, and helped my significant other and I (first time buyers!) feel empowered navigating a complex market.  Also super grateful for his flexibility: whether it was meeting at properties or reviewing offer documents, our home buying journey felt like a real priority for Danny."
2948,0.2994618055555555,"Normally I wouldn't use movers to move from home to home because I usually have friends and family to help and before this move it was very minimal stuff and I was alone. This time around I'm married with an 8 year old son and a pregnant wife, who couldn't help with most of the heavy lifting. She searched on Facebook Mom group and heard Mancav Movers were the best in town. From the minute we asked for a quote online, I had gotten a call from Danny, the owner of Mancav Movers. We had such a great conversation and it led me to book them for my move. They arrived on time and honestly it was the best experience I could've asked for. They handled all my furniture and wrapped it and made sure nothing would've damaged it. It was a 3 man team from a high rise building to a condo on the 2nd floor with no elevator. Those boys did not complain, not once did I see them tired or slowing down. Bryan was my first point of contact and he was an awesome person. He made conversation with me and made me feel at ease that everything will be handled great. Jose was one of the other guys and man he was awesome too. I didn't catch the 3rd persons name but again this team was just amazing. We got this move done in a short 5 hours and it could've been done quicker hadn't it been for the rain that delayed the drive and loading and unloading of furniture. I definitely will use again and definitely will recommend this moving company to everyone I know. They were punctual, well prepared, genuine, helpful and all around amazing and made me a very customer. Thank you Mancav for this amazing experience."

779,0.2993939393939394,"Leneya was an asset during our home selling process. We decided to move out of the area and called Leneya for assistance. She made lots of personal time for us between the initial consulting, followup up, staging (and the most important part) the selling process. Our house was listed for more than we expected and sold at asking price. Her advice is excellent, she is very quick to respond to questions, and she was fun to work with. I highly recommend her to anyone who is looking for a professional that can get it done."
2778,0.29930555555555555,"Tod exceeded our expectations in every way!  He essentially provided us with service you'd expect from a good full service agent at an extremely affordable flat rate price.

From providing an exhaustive market analysis, to taking gorgeous photos showcasing the home, and then helping us to negotiate through multiple offers the first week our home was on the market Tod did a great job!

From beginning to our close, he was responsive and professional.  We never once felt like we were receiving cut rate service.  Strongly recommend him to anyone in DFW area considering listing their home!"

From the 1st inquiry I made with Nathan and follow up phone calls to meeting 4 young men at my door (right on time) on a very rainy Memorial Day, it could not have been a smoother day, with the exception of the pouring rain!  Our movers were: JC, Aaron, Gamez & Byron. They were polite, professional and so careful with our things! My husband and I are 60+ and they were so patient and helpful with questions. Byron noticed me trying to put the bedding in a bag, stopped what he was doing and did it for me. He said more than once (We are here to help make this easier for you""!

Everyone from Beau who I talked to initially for the bid, to ladies who answered the phone to our actual movers (Charles, Damar, Carlos & Juan) were awesome. The guys that moved us were so polite, concerned with how we wanted things done, took very good care wrapping our furniture, and efficient! We never heard one complaint and it was a very hot and humid August day with lots of large and heavy pieces! Worth every penny."

He responded very quickly and explained the process to us thoroughly.  When he came out to look at the property he was very respectful and once again explained the process and let us know he would be available to us for any questions or concerns we had. He kept great communication throughout the entire process, even the small details he would let us know. He remained respectful and informative the entire time and we really appreciated that."

I highly recommend the Bushwick team!"
12023,0.2983333333333334,"David made the experience of purchasing my first home absolutely painless.  From the way that he thoughtfully arranged our initial tour to the details discussed during negotiation, he made sure to listen to what I was looking for and to add valuable insights along the way.   It's worthwhile to note that I never felt pressured in any way to put in an offer or to move forward with a home that I was unsure of either.

Being an out-of-town buyer, it was imperative to work with someone that was detail-oriented, trust-worthy, proactive and communicative.  David checked off all of those boxes.  We were able to close on the first condo that I put in an offer for, without entering a bidding war and without any undue stress, despite the other competitive offers on the table.

I would highly recommend David to anyone looking for a home in the highly competitive South Florida market. He is professional, friendly, beyond accommodating and helpful.  He will work alongside you to not only find the best home, but also create the best offer for your individual needs.

Thank you, David!"

The problem was, in such a frenzied market there was virtually zero inventory of what I needed: a two bedroom condo with an east facing view towards the water. Dave was my relentless shepherd and advocate throughout this process. In a situation where condos could be scarfed up in a day, he found my perfect unit and we won the bidding thanks to his advice.

Very informative through the process. We moved from north of Seattle to the peninsula, they gave us the option of whether they took the ferry or drove around. Very transparent about fees, quoted 9 hours plus ferry surcharge ended up 9.25 with no ferry because they thought it would be about the same time. They were right. Super respectful of cleanliness even the apartment we were moving out of. I cannot tell you enough good things about this company. I hope we never move again but if we do I hope Kyle and Easy Company are available. Also ask about why he named it Easy Company."

11307,0.2975814536340852,"As first time home buyers, my husband and I had no idea what we were doing. Luckily my mom stumbled upon the Big Sound Homes website and got us connected with Geoff. There was absolutely no pressure from him to look for houses, he simply asked us what we were looking for and when we were interested in buying. He then set us up with an automated home search and email notification system which allowed us to get a feel for what was out there, which areas we liked and what to expect to pay. When we had a few listings bookmarked, he emailed us and said he was going to be in the neighborhood and to see if we wanted to take a look at some of the houses on our list. He was very honest with us and let us know when he thought a house was overpriced. It felt like he was on our side and not just trying to make a sale. Geoff then suggested we go to this class for first time home buyers. This was probably the greatest suggestion we had ever gotten, after we took the class we knew so much more about how home buying works and weren't as intimidated by the process. Now that our confidence was up we were ready to start seriously looking and Geoff made that very easy. The moment we decided to put an offer on a house he immediately started drawing up the paper work (this was at 10pm). When issues arose during inspection and closing he was right there with us laying out our options and giving advice as how to best proceed. If you are looking for an agent who is extremely knowledgeable, not pushy, and eager to answer your questions then Geoff would be the person to see when you buy a house."

8947,0.29741115196078427,"I have no regrets working with Stephanie Shin and her team at Every Door!!!

Home buying is stressful - especially as a first time home buyer. No matter how relaxed you are or your approach is, the accumulation of realty questions, jargon, and procedures can be overwhelming. Whenever I felt that way, I‚Äôd take my broker up on her offer and reach out to her. Her communication is top notch! Her disposition was always calm and collected. She did a fantastic job guiding me step by step through the entire process, from house showings, introducing me to lenders, discussing our approach to making offers, introducing me to inspectors, revisiting the offer after inspection, keeping communication open during the appraisal process, HOA document reviews, final negotiations, to final signing and closing!, and everything else done in between in the background. She‚Äôs well knowledgeable and has a strong team to support her (especially with the immediate e-forms!). What I appreciate most about her is her candor and her genuine desire to make sure her clients feel good moving forward every step of the way."

With that I wanted an experienced, professional negotiator on my side for the best possible outcome. That is where Trelora came in with a team approach.

She was so efficient in scheduling tours for us and always available for questions and changes to schedule - she was so flexible and always had a great attitude.  When we finally settled on a house, the seller was actually pretty difficult and uncommunicative, but Penny took initiative and got us the answers we needed and advocated for us at every turn.  I am so happy that we met Penny and she worked with us in our house purchase, I do not think the experience would have been as nice or as pleasant without her, I highly recommend her and her team!"

8877,0.2951388888888889,"Geoff is an amazing realtor, top to bottom. While finding and purchasing our home, he consistently provided excellent service and guidance every step of the way. Every review you will read is spot-on about how knowledgeable, level-headed, and professional Geoff is, and what a true delight he is to work with.

Before talking with Geoff, I had tried to work with a few other agents and a referral from a friend, but was left underwhelmed and disappointed. By comparison, Geoff not only took the time to really understand what we were looking for, but he always made himself available to help or walk me through anything and everything I ran past him. He was incredibly flexible and accommodating when it came to touring homes or answering my many questions over the phone and made sure we were always taken care of.

Geoff was a great help when it came to referrals of inspectors and especially with lenders, and I never felt pressured to do anything I was not prepared for. Every suggestion was backed up by evidence or experience, and I felt I was in good hands throughout the entire process. Geoff has deep knowledge of both the current market and of the area's real estate history; at every house we toured, he would provide pros and cons to help us be well informed and supported in making the best decision.

On top of being first-time buyers (and incredibly picky at that), we ran into a few unforseen obstacles that made finding and purchasing a house challenging. Geoff helped guide us through these roadblocks in stride, and consistently demonstrated that he was willing to fight for our best interests as his clients.

Thanks to his diligence, we have purchased an amazing home that we could not be happier with. I wholeheartedly recommend working with Geoff, and hope to do so again myself in the future!"

6267,0.29375,"Abraham is a wonderful realtor. His knowledge of the Miami area is unmatched. It was almost as if he had memorized the buildings and the units therein. He knew which way the buildings were facing, whether there was construction outside of them, when they were coming available, and everything in between almost completely off the top of his head. It was such a joy to work with him.
And if that wasn‚Äôt enough, there is no time of the day that he isn‚Äôt willing to accommodate, and work with other‚Äôs schedules, he is completely responsive and in touch with his clients at all times. Even on his days off. I wouldn‚Äôt trust anyone else. Phenomenal."

3344,0.293681891025641,"Andrew and Arturo were great movers. They asked questions and pointed out possible issues (an old cabinet that was a little rickety, or shelves that would most likely come loose when the cabinet was moved) and took the time to make sure everything was secure or removed to be moved separately. They also ensured everything in the house was safe (removing a ceiling light shade, taking care around corners). The truck wouldn't fit into the driveway of the delivery location, but the guys quickly moved my stuff and were on their way. 100% would recommend Wild Cat Movers. Very clear communication and great prices."

Thank you Exodus for making our move stress free."

I would highly recommend anyone looking for moving services to go with Magic Moving!"

I called about a week before my move and they were able to fit me in. They arrived on time promptly. This time the team consisted of Costel, Nathan P., and Jesus. These guys were so friendly and efficient - I ended up having 2 drop off locations and they were able to complete the job in 4-5 hours with no issues. They were professional and personable which is really nice when you are going through something stressful like moving! If you are in the Greater Seattle Area and need movers I would definitely recommend these guys. I will be using them in the future for sure!"

They finished way sooner than estimated and were even able to take a few old mattresses and box springs to the dump/donation site for us. I would use them again in a heartbeat.

8736,0.2928571428571428,"Redfin makes available to potential buyers and sellers a wealth of data relevant to real estate decisions. The Redfin website is second to none in transparency, navigability and presentation of information. I find the reviews posted by Redfin agents of homes they have toured in the Seattle area very insightful, especially the reviews by Joe Hunter. I can also vouch for the professionalism of Redfin brokers Chad Diericks and Collin Horn and their associates.  When I listed my condo after I became interested in another condo for purchase, Chad represented me on the listing and Collin on the purchase.  I appreciated both their attention to detail, knowledge of the market, good sense and efficiency, but what impressed me even more was how they treated me when I changed my mind and decided to de-list my condo.  Their support and interest in customer service did not diminish one iota. I definitely recommend them and Redfin as a whole!"

He went out of his way to put myself in the best position to purchase the property such as building rapport with the listing agent and providing me with nearby comps to evaluate the market price. He provided me the tools necessary to independently analyze the property while remaining unbiased. Additionally, he was very flexible to meet my walkthrough and inspection dates scheduled at early hours. Chris had my best interest in mind throughout the process. He is friendly, informative and genuine. With Chris' help, purchasing my first home was a very smooth process. I highly recommended Chris and will continue to use Chris in the future!"

11917,0.2922348484848485,"Working with Jacquie on the purchase of my Seattle condo was unlike any other real estate experience I have had. From the outset I appreciated her obvious love of and enthusiasm for residential homes. This, together with her excellent design eye brought a laser focus on possibilities and market upside to the initial properties she sent for my review. I was impressed by how quickly Jacquie came to know my taste, style, and requirements through our early discussions and review of a few initial listings. It did not take long to find a property that fit my location and aesthetic preferences that was also, remarkably, under my budget. Jacquie‚Äôs work did not stop when the sale transacted. She generously welcomed me into my new place and provided additional support during my remodeling process. From start to end she has been professional, has worked tirelessly for me, and never lost her wonderful sense of humor. She is most definitely my realtor for life."
1819,0.2921506000774293,"Eli Hutchison was the perfect agent for my family and I for 3 reasons:

1)	Eli was extremely diligent. Before we even selected Eli as our agent, he helped us tour 3-5 homes on a moment‚Äôs notice. He was patient, fastidious, organized, and timely. He was very flexible, catered to our busy schedules and was always there when we needed him. In a highly competitive market where the best homes have offers within seconds, Eli is exactly the type of agent you need.

2)	Eli was an amazing communicator. He responded back to all our texts and phone-calls in a timely fashion, made the terms of our home contract super clear, and clearly explained each step that was needed. He helped us understand esoteric real estate terms such as escrow, earnest money, appraisal buffers, and coverage gaps. Many agents are bogged down by overextending themselves. Eli made sure we felt heard and was involved through every step of the process.

3)	Eli was very caring. Through his advice, we were able to work with our lender to cut down on costs by $1,000s of dollars. He studied the market carefully to help us determine the most competitive and cost-effective offer possible. He never pressured us into making a decision on a home, and was very candid about each house‚Äôs pros and cons. Through this stressful process, his patience was very appreciated. He was extremely attentive to our needs and worked to get us in the best home for us, not the quickest.

Eli was polite, driven, congenial, and involved throughout the whole process. He also got us an amazing closing gift and most importantly helped us find the PERFECT home for us. We seriously can't believe what a perfect match it has been for our needs. We check the market every week and are SHOCKED what a great price we got it at.

Without Eli, I am certain we would not have gotten this home. Should we ever be on the home market again, we will definitely work with Eli Hutchison. I recommend him for all your real estate needs!

1847,0.2921052631578947,"Eunice was an incredible resource as we navigated our first home-buying experience. She met each of our many questions with a sincere, thoughtful, and data-backed response, and helped us remain grounded and informed in what could be described as a crazy market.

A few specific highlights of working with her included:
1) Her architecture background and knowledge proved to be an amazing bonus, as she was able to help us weigh both the pros/cons of various properties and how they might align with our purchasing goals.
2) Without our prompting, Eunice also was able to identify and share with us potential issues and regulatory gaps in several potential homes. She had our best interests at heart.
3) She helped guide us as our home criteria evolved, often stepping in as a sounding board.

Eunice was communicative, proactive, and kind through every step of the process. She goes above and beyond for her clients even pre/post purchase, and we'd wholeheartedly recommend her to our own network and beyond."

David Perez kept me informed every step of the way and quickly returned my calls when I had questions. Great Job.

It has been 25+ years since I had to close on a house sale transaction and then we had to go through a lot of hoops and paperwork.  Then, the funding was in the form of a check at closing, so was nervous about signing everything and waiting a couple of days for funding, but once again David and the title company kept me informed and funding was quick and easy.

Like all buyers, I would have preferred a higher selling price, but it all worked out.

10440,0.2915412748171368,"We had such a great experience working with Kelly!

My wife and I first met Kelly at an open house for a new construction home. Even though the house was well outside our price range and we weren‚Äôt serious buyers, he was so nice and took the time to answer all our questions, and even emailed us some follow up information. A few weeks later after a not-so-great experience with our broker at the time, we reached out to Kelly for representation. He was so wonderful to work with. Being first time homebuyers, he ‚Äúheld our hands‚Äù and coached us through the entire process.

Kelly is incredibly knowledgeable about the housing and construction market, pricing and negotiation strategies, and ultimately, he helped us secure and close a relatively complex purchase. Additionally, he provided us great references for financing, home inspections, locksmiths, and various other services.

However, our favorite attribute about Kelly‚Ä¶he is just a great person! Kind, honest, patient, intelligent, punctual, and communicates exceptionally well.

10613,0.29117647058823526,"We worked with Doron for several months on a planned re-location to the Seattle area. He was enormously helpful in helping us identify neighborhoods that were appealing to us and convenient to things like shopping and entertainment.

At all times Doron was available via phone, text and emails with near immediate response to our questions and suggestions.

Once we decided on a house, Doron demonstrated his experience in this market and in these challenging times. We were able to make an offer, open escrow and close the sale with zero issues.

Because of Doron's experience we were able to bid intelligently and get a great price in a market that is extremely competitive.

At all times Doron was professional, warm and ready with a sharp sense of humor. We would heartily recommend him and his team for any real estate transaction you may need."

I've worked with Matt and Ian to buy 2 homes, once as a first time home buyer. What I appreciated the most working with them in this market is  is they're incredibly knowledgeable + were patient with me, yet honest about houses that would likely go for outside my price range, would have poor resell value, or wouldn't fit my lifestyle. We didn't waste time on houses that wouldn't work, and when the opportunity finally came up for one that was a great fit, they acted quickly and helped me write the winning bid (and it wasn't even the highest offer!)."

I sent her messages and emails to ask all kinds of questions, even sometimes late at night,  she always responded immediately. She negotiated the best possible deal for us, and we won the bid in a multiple offer situation, even though we weren't the highest offer. And our competing offer was a lot higher than ours.

10932,0.29058441558441556,"Danny was instrumental in our first home buying experience. He was knowledgeable, responsible, direct and pragmatic, all qualities that we appreciate in people we work with. He also gave us room to be ourselves and do things at our own pace, no pressure whatsoever. This allowed him to understand what we wanted, where we wanted, which made a big difference in the final steps of funneling and picking.
When it came to closing, we informed Danny that we were in a tight schedule and he made sure he was one step ahead of all parts involved, anticipating blockers and assigning tasks, and assuring smooth sailing to the closing date.
We loved working with Danny and will surely do it again when the time comes!"

The process went so smoothly, and she was an absolute pleasure to work with. She offered her opinion when we asked and helped us to consider things we hadn‚Äôt thought of.

Danny was always available for any question or concern, always patient and kind and even patted me on the back as I cried when I listed my home. He also worked seamlessly with my agent 800 miles away where I was trying to make an offer on a new home. The whole process, a crisis rite at best, was made so much easier because Danny was part of the process. I highly recommend him!"

I completed one of those ""search Questionnaire"" for Movers and was BOMBARDED with phone calls.  In addition, I did my own GOOGLE search and located many.  Wow!  this was the toughest job!  There are sooooooo many companies with sooooo many different prices and sooooo much BS of ""charges for this and charges for that"" I though I would loose it! LOL... I then found THIS company and spoke to a very nice young lady by the name of Josslene(I'm not sure how to spell her name).  She gave me an EXCELLENT and competitive price, plus assured me the movers would come the next day in the morning.  I got so nervous because it sounded to good to be true and I HAD to move this furniture from my rental property that morning.  True to their word. they arrive on time the next morning!  My movers were named Ruben and Alberto.  WOW!! These two guys were INCREDIBLE!!!!!  They disassembled my three beds, wrapped all my living room furniture in plastic and dining room furniture - then took it downstairs and loaded their truck!  Their supervisor even popped in and began to help. Also, this company, like most, has a three hour minimum and I think it took them no more than an hour and a half.  Then they drove it to my storage facility and carried all this stuff to my storage!  Rueben and Alberto were just FANTASTIC!!  They were also very friendly and pleasant.  Let me just say, I don't believe the negative reviews are coming from customers.  I believe its probably some of their competitors.  Trust me, LOOK NO FURTHER!  This company is truly fantastic.  You will not be disappointed. :-)"

I had a very drawn out home buying process that lasted over 8 months and took us to all corners of Seattle. I kept changing what I was looking for, from a condo to a fixer-upper to a move-in ready house and Kelly was always happy to help explain and educate the differences in what I would be looking at. I nearly closed on a condo with Kelly and, at the start of COVID, a week before closing the bank backed out (that's what I get for not using Kelly's recommended lender!), but as soon as I got over the frustration with the lender Kelly was ready with several new places to tour. The misfire on the condo turned out to be a blessing in disguise because I ended up with the most perfect house. Kelly is extremely professional and knows his stuff, every question I asked he either had an answer to or knew who to get the answer from and I never felt like I was making a decision without having all the necessary information available to me.

Tod is an expert but what made the difference was his patience, understanding, knowledge,  availability and excellent ease of conversation and information exchange.  He was very mindful of our time and he's never been late while spending all the time we needed (and we needed a lot). Unlike other agents Tod will never push you on making a decision.  Quite the opposite: he will spend time with you analyzing together whether a particular property is fit for your requirements and offer advice, if you need it.  He was there for us and with us all the way to the closing day.  We are very grateful for his service.  Thank you, Tod!"

They wrapped everything with plastic wrap or with both wrap and blankets. We had 9 movers all day for our project and they were nice all day long. We did not have any damage - if something was already torn or scratched, they noticed ahead of time and pointed it out to us.

When we arrived at our new home, they put out a rubber mat for both entrances in order to protect our floors. We appreciated their extreme attention to detail, the courteous attitudes, and their tremendous efficiency. Thank you, AB Movers for a job well done!"

4718,0.28633557800224463,"We found Easy Company Moving while searching for moving companies to help from our move from Greenwood neighborhood to North Beacon Hill. We needed some movers and booked them about 2 weeks before our move in date.

I had contacted a few companies already but Kyle's responsiveness to messages and the fact that it was a local company helped persuade me to go with them. He quickly sent me a quote by that night and we booked the date.

Our original meet-up time was at 10am (to avoid that Seattle traffic) but they exceeded my expectations and arrived 20 minutes early at 9:40am! They called to make sure it was okay and of course it was. I had a team of 3 people which were Daniel, Jose and Peter. All of our things were mostly packed but we had a bunch of scragglers that we were intending to bring ourselves. The movers moved and loaded all of our pre-packed things within the hour and then even came and helped packed the extra things hanging around. We didn't expect that and were super appreciative of that.

We had quite a few pieces of fragile furniture and they were all packed with care. Everything arrived to the new townhouse in perfect condition and they moved everything in quickly and safely which was quite a feat since we only had stairs going to our new place and stairs inside the townhouse.

They finished under the time I was quoted and I was so impressed at their service that it was definitely reflected in their tips. Overall, I'm glad to have supported a local business and they have exceeded my expectations so much I would gladly recommend and use them again!"

He is incredibly fast at responding to calls, texts, and emails.  He provided honest feedback about the upsides and downsides of the property I ended up purchasing.  When it came time to put down an offer he walked me through multiple options and explained the potential risk factors.  I felt like I was able to make an informed decision.  The inspector he recommended was thorough, kind, and walked me through everything in his report.  Though my purchase amount was small, I always felt like a top priority to Geoff throughout the process.  The whole process was stress free, and my new home is the perfect fit for me."

From start to finish, the experience was nothing short of exceptional. Their attention to detail and commitment to quality is unparalleled. Every aspect of the project was executed with precision and care, resulting in a home that not only met our expectations, but exceeded them.

What truly sets them apart is their honesty and integrity. They were transparent throughout the entire process, providing clear communication and ensuring that we were always informed and comfortable with every decision. There were no hidden costs or surprises, just straightforward and honest interactions that made us feel confident and secure.

Working with Eric specifically was an absolute pleasure. Under his leadership, his team was professional, courteous, and genuinely passionate about their work. They listened to our needs, offered valuable suggestions, and made the entire process smooth and stress-free. The craftsmanship is outstanding, and it's evident that they take immense pride in what they do.

11022,0.2860969387755102,"Geoff deserves 6 out of 5 stars! As first-time home buyers who had just moved from out-of-state, he was there through every step of our journey in this highly competitive market. My husband and I reached out to Geoff even before we moved to Seattle. His professionalism, knowledge about the local market and friendly demeanor won us over immediately. Even before we met him, Geoff would take time out of his busy schedule to check out houses and do video walk-throughs to send us. We highly recommend Geoff as an agent and here are some top reasons why: 1) He goes above and beyond for his clients ‚Äì even with his insanely busy schedule, he's incredibly responsive at any time of day/night. 2) He is very honest and offers great advice, never pressuring us ‚Äì in fact, he even talked us OUT of a couple homes, knowing they weren‚Äôt quite right for our family. 3) He ‚Äúknows a guy‚Äù for anything you might need in the home-buying process, including his recommendation for our loan officer, who closed our home from due-date to keys-delivered in just 3 weeks! 4) His ability to connect and form personal relationships with everyone in the home-buying process, not only with his clients. This was a true differentiator in what makes him so unique and successful. At the end of the day, you'll feel like you've made a friend. 5) On the rare occasions when Geoff‚Äôs not available to show a home in a pinch, you'll get to work with his partner Kelly, who is also awesome! We won a bid on our dream house in a great Seattle neighborhood over 4 other compelling offers (one in all cash!) and could never have done it without Geoff. If you‚Äôre looking for a world-class real estate agent, look no further - Geoff Hill is your man!"

I have worked with many realtors in the past, and Guy by far was the best. I admittedly had ambitious budget considerations, apartment&location requirements. Guy was patient and choosy in finding apartment options that were the best for my lifestyle, he was prompt in his communication and he was very accommodating of my schedule & last minute requests. He wasn‚Äôt the least bit pushy in pushing us towards making a hasty decision, and ultimately was successful in negotiating a rent that was lower than the asking rate.

He was very transparent and honest about the different realities in the local market, which made the process much easier on our end. I recommend working with Guy without hesitation.

The best recommendation I can give is that I will hope to have Guy and his team support me when it‚Äôs time to buy a home in the area."

After this discussion, they booked it. I did not once see any one of the 3 guys standing around and not helping, they were busy hard at work. I have never had movers move so quickly to help me get everything done right within 2 hours. They were kind and respectful, and handled all of my items with care.

She was very responsive and went out of her way to meet us on evenings and weekends. Thanks to Crystal's expertise, we got a great house, in a great location, for a reasonable price (in this crazy Seattle market).

7421,0.28521703521703523,"Can I give Matt, Ian and their team more than 5 stars? My TL;DR version is this: Choose the Get Happy at Home team. You won‚Äôt regret it. My husband and I have now purchased two homes in Seattle (both being the first places we offered on each time) and sold a townhome in Columbia City for a record breaking price in the neighborhood. We were introduced to Ian back in 2014 through a first-time homebuyers program my work offered. We were immediately impressed with his intimate knowledge of the real estate market in Seattle, and appreciated his local knowledge as resident in the area we were looking to buy in. After taking us out on a whirlwind weekend of looking at homes (we flew in from out-of-state just for the weekend), he helped us make the decision to offer on a townhome in Columbia City that we ended up getting due to his kick-ass offer and sweet letter he wrote to the sellers. This was the first place we offered on, and there were 3 other offers, one of which was actually higher than ours. Flash forward three years and we contacted Ian when we were ready to upgrade homes, and got introduced to Matt, Ian and Trang. We had no reservations about working with his team, and were again super impressed with the skill and expertise this team has in navigating the tricky currents of the Seattle real estate market. After helping us prep our townhome for sale, we ended up getting 4 offers leading to a record breaking sale price for townhomes in our neighborhood. Almost as soon as the ink had dried on the winning offer for our townhome, we put in an offer on a home in Leschi. Literally, two days after we had accepted an offer on our townhome, we had our offer accepted (again, first offer) on our dream home. Matt and Ian guided us through the hectic timelines for buying and selling a home at a same time, such that our offer would have no contingencies, and we closed on our new home 2 days after the sale of our townhome closed. 3 weeks and two days after putting our townhome on the market, we were moving boxes into the most perfect home we could have imagined in Leschi. This is all to say that, these guys are real estate gods, and they know what they are talking about. Follow what they say, and you‚Äôll soon be happy in your dream home. Thank you so much, Matt, Ian, Amber and Trang, for all the tireless hours you worked getting us to where we are now. 6 months later and we still can‚Äôt believe how lucky we are that we have this beautiful home :)"

3835,0.28509264069264073,"We hired Pure Moving Company for a move within Seattle and had an excellent experience with them. The team was incredibly nice, helpful, attentive to details, and worked extremely hard.

The moving crew that came displayed professionalism and expertise throughout the process. They handled every item with meticulous care. From fragile dishes to bulky furniture, everything was packed securely and transported without any damage or mishaps.They even brought boxes for our clothes that were hung up.

What impressed me the most was their commitment to customer satisfaction. They listened attentively to my instructions and made sure that everything was placed exactly as I wanted in my new home. Their dedication to hard work was evident as they tirelessly loaded and unloaded the truck, overcoming obstacles with ease.

Overall, I highly recommend this moving company. Their exceptional service, friendly and attentive team, attention to detail, and hard work made my move stress-free. If you're looking for a moving company that genuinely cares about your satisfaction and works diligently to ensure a smooth move, this is the one to choose. Thank you to the entire team for a job well done!

Will continue to use them for all our moving needs and will recommend them to friends and family!"

They answered calls promptly, are courteous, transparent, and kept their promises. They picked up the furniture and the car when said they would and deliver them on time.

The entire process was seamless and free of any problems.

Moving from Texas to California in the middle of a pandemic is pretty scary, which makes this experience even more meaningful to us.

Thank you for everything all the best in 2021 and always."

They were easy to work with, showed up on time, made helpful suggestions, and were great with setting things up in the new house. Their pricing was comparable, if not a bit better, than the other companies I contacted for quotes, but what sealed the deal was the friendly, non-pressure, responses I got. Highly recommended."

11291,0.28484126984126984,"Geoff rocks! He guided us through the crazy market that is Seattle. It took us four tries, but we finally landed a great house. He knows all the ins and outs to craft a great offer and is a great negotiator. He recognized our preferences in a house and made us aware of aspects of certain properties that may not be desirable. There was one hiccup in his intuition on the second home we placed an offer on. We attributed it to the wacky and unpredictable market conditions that were just beginning. Other than that, he was always attentive and more than happy to answer our questions. Get Geoff on your side!"
10733,0.2848039215686274,"My wife and I had used traditional agents before--once to buy a house, and once to sell that same house. We just couldn't see the value, especially on the buying end. If you are prepared to browse MLS listings on your own (like we did anyway with our traditional buyers agent), you can save a boatload of money going with a flat-fee agent like Walaw. They charge about $5,000, which includes attorney fees. Their fees are significantly lower than Redfin, so we went with them. Though we were paying less with Walaw, they were better in every way than our previous buyers' agent: they were more experienced, more honest, and smarter.

I've been recommending Walaw (and more generally, the flat-fee model) to everyone I know. It's a no-brainer. We ended up saving $17,125 with Walaw when compared to a traditional agent. I just can't see how home buyers are leaving that kind of money on the table. Go with Walaw, people!"

We came out of it all extremely satisfied with Guy and our condo. I highly recommend working with Guy and will continue to do so moving forward."
11242,0.2847575757575758,"My experience with Rawlins was excellent. As a first time home buyer, I was very apprehensive throughout the entire home buying process but it was evident that Rawlins had paid attention to exactly what I was looking for and he was able to find me a house that suited me very well and was within my designated budget. There were times that I was considering abandoning the whole home buying process completely, but Rawlins was patient and thoughtful in addressing not only my concerns with the seller but also my questions regarding the entire home buying process. In addition, he succeeded in getting me a significant discount on the listing price for the home I ended up buying. I could not be more through thrilled and I feel very fortunate to have had Rawlins as my real estate agent. My profession does not allow for much flexibility in my schedule so I really appreciated his ability to listen to what I said I needed and to execute finding it in a timely and resourceful fashion. I'm excited about my new home and if at some point in the future, I choose to find a new home, I will definitely like to work with Rawlins and his team again. It's not often that one encounters this kind of attention to detail. I could not be happier with the outcome of this entire process and I am so thankful to Rawlins and his team for going out of their way to get me such an amazing deal. I can't believe I'm a homeowner!"

6844,0.28452380952380957,"Selling a high-end home in Northeast Florida, we first tried zillow as ""for sale by owner"". We got a lot of views, some spam, but no real offers until the owners of Richr contacted me and explained their free no-frills listing service, including free listing on a national MLS and other sites (incl zillow). After checking them out, and getting a estimate of final closing costs, we decided to try Richr.com.
They gave great advice (really free) and their system was easy to use to fill in the MLS form and upload pictures. They even made some helpful edits and suggestions, which were then uploaded to a MLS system and most other online sites. Viewing increased, and even the zillow estimate moved up in value.
I found them to be very helpful, and followed up with me regularly.  No hidden charges, great service, i give them 5 stars and would use them again if i needed to sell another house."

8648,0.2842699724517907,"My husband and I can‚Äôt thank Sage at LacMont enough for all his work and advice in helping us purchase a home. We recently moved from Chicago to the Seattle area, and started working with two other real estate brokers before being introduced to Sage. We connected with him immediately, and loved his energy, hard work, and humor. He listened to us about what we wanted in a home, gave us great insight into the local real estate market, which was very hot, and advice on what we would need to do to win if things got competitive. We never felt pressured, and when it came time to make an offer, Sage crafted a strong and creative one that worked within our parameters and which was accepted!

Looking back, Sage made what has been in the past for us a very stressful process feel more like fun, and he kept us both upbeat and positive throughout the whole process. I already recommended a friend who will be moving to Seattle to speak with Sage, since I know she, like I am sure all others, will be in very good hands."

After speaking to Chris on the phone, we decided to tap one of the mortgage brokers he referred us to and to our surprise we found that we qualified!
Chris took us out looking multiple times - he was incredibly knowledgeable about real estate in general and in the neighborhoods we looked in. Once we had looked at a couple things and talked about how we planned to use the home, things really started hopping! Chris dialed in on great properties and recommended neighborhoods we had not thought of! This all led to us getting the perfect place for us!

11960,0.2827462121212121,"This 5 star rating is all because of Sharon Ashlaya.
We purchased an investment property for the first time through Sharon. Quite simply, it would not have happened if we were working with anyone other than Sharon.
She is honest, patient, professional, hardworking and resourceful. If she doesn't know something herself, she will consult with someone else and get the information. Her priority is client's best interest and nothing else. Another huge plus is her friendliness and likeable personality that makes it very easy for her to work with and negotiate with other people. Lastly, she is an optimist with always positive outlook on things. That's what actually saved the deal from falling through a couple of times.
If you are lucky enough to get Sharon as your agent, you can rest assured that you are in good hands."

This sweet lady is a #1 professional, who only has her client's well being and satisfaction in mind.
I've never before experienced such caring and knowledge from a real estate agent.
She made the whole process so easy from start to finish.  Always answered every text and phone call and got any information I needed asap.  Mrs. Diaz knows how to get the job done.
A funny story, on our walk-through before closing, she noticed in mbr that mirror closet doors would not slide.  She tried so hard to fix it and couldn't do it.  She was beyond dissatisfied.  I told her to please stop, and just to let you all know, I fixed it myself, just as I said I would.
Im hoping this is happy news for her.
I would highly recommend Mrs. Diaz to anyone in need of selling or buying a new home.  She's flawless in her profession.
She had to deal with me here in Florida and my significant other living in Canada at the moment.  Never faulted in anything that needed to be done.
Her kindness is noted in so many ways.  Upon leaving my home, she presented me with a bottle of wine and a gracious gift.  I accepted with gratitude as I know she only wanted to please.
This is your go to agent.  She will make the process so easy.  Remember the name, Alba Diaz.
Thank you from my heart and so enjoying our new home.  We are family nowüíñ you are my shining star.

Josh will spend his time on your behalf making inquiries and doing research, he will show up for you again and again, he will treat your search for THE house as his personal mandate and will treat you like you are his only client. Josh takes the time getting to know you and what you are looking for! He truly invests in his relationships with his clients, and it shows in the quality of the services he provides. This is someone who deeply cares about his clients. We have met our fair share of flakey, unresponsive, dramatic, wishy-washy realtors, and it is incredibly refreshing to meet someone as professional and deeply committed to his work as Josh. He is truly one of a kind, not only as a real estate agent, but as a human being. We consider ourselves lucky to be his clients!

4482,0.2818518518518519,"Billy has been a god-send! To start with some background, my wife and I began searching in Summer '20, and spent six months with a different agent. We struggled to find homes we liked and felt like we were really compromising on our first home. We also felt like we did not have a competitive edge when bidding on homes. We went through a lot of tours and offers and kept coming out empty handed.

Eventually, we decided to try a different agent. We chose Billy after an initial phone call. We explained our needs; we wanted to be more aggressive and direct with our offers. We also asked for more guidance in the house hunt.

Billy immediately met our demand. I was impressed that Billy was able to  get us into the house quickly as this can be very challenging with COVID-19 restrictions.  We had high expectations and Billy met each of our requests.

We went through 4 serious offers with Billy. On each offer, Billy proved to be an invaluable asset. As soon as we were interested in a home, Billy would do his research and come to us with what a winning offer might look  like. We never felt like he was sugar-coating it. Billy's input was inpressively accurate for each offer which is an incredible display of intuition and instinct. With all the competition out there in the Seattle market, it's a great feeling when your agent constantly puts you in win-able scenarios. Highly recommended!"

The crew that arrived for my job worked diligently, they wrapped all the furniture thoroughly and it all looked outstanding, they took it seriously.  Especially when packing the storage unit -- they really thought it through and put the puzzle pieces together.

I came to our first meeting with tons of questions and Justin was able to answer all, and provide good advice. We then started the process of obtaining a loan, and worked with lenders Justin recommended (who were great). We found a townhome we wanted to put an offer on and Justin moved quickly. It was 4 pm on a Friday but he worked after hours to get the offer placed. He then negotiated with us and the seller on Saturday to secure the deal! We were a little worried about going under offer price in this current housing economy, but Justin was able to secure us a 5k closing cost credit, essentially reducing the total cost by 5k, which is amazing given the climate. Justin and his team then worked with us over the following weeks to close. They advocated for us during the inspections and walkthroughs. We are 6 days post moving in and they are still following up and helping us with any issues we have. Highly recommend Justin and the Wagner real estate group! If you're hesitant in buying (as my partner was) I recommend just jumping into the process and learning more. You can always back off later if the timing isn't right to buy, but we're happy we jumped right in!"

She was kind, courteous, patient and very helpful. She texted or called me back promptly with every question and made me feel like she really cared about my house and situation.
She advised me out of a few of the first offers and when we had a good bite she told me to reel it in! We sold my house with no trouble even though it was an ""estate"" and I was missing a lot of information like when the roof was last repaired, foundation damage, overgrown, etc.

Danni helped make sure my estimates were accurate and that I accounted for all of my stuff while not being over charged (moved 1 bedroom out of a 3 bedroom house).

Boris especially was on top of everything, he made sure that things were packed with padding, that furniture was padded and secured, and fully disassembled things to maximize the truck space.

I would recommend eco movers, and request this same crew by name if possible.

This will be my 4th move in the past 10 years, and I wish all movers were this good and this diligent. It's also the only move I have had where no one tried to increase the price at some point, which I credit to both Danni helping to make sure that we were properly estimated and Boris to doing a great job packing."

11117,0.28048340548340545,"I loved working with the Divas! Not only do they know their stuff, but they do it in style and make it fun! I was shopping for my first place. Awesome reviews online led me to Kim and Chavi, so we set up a time to chat. The Divas were like mediums channeling my wish-list in a house hunting s√©ance. They completely understood my wants, needs, target neighborhoods, budget, etc. After taking everything into account, they pointed to the map and said ‚Äúthis one first.‚Äù We took the tour, and I really liked what I saw. Still, having seen only one place, I was feeling indecisive and the Diva‚Äôs had compiled a lot of other excellent options to explore. There was zero pressure, no false sense of urgency. It was at my pace, on my schedule, and it was fun. I‚Äôm convinced that they would have stuck with me, touring condos and having cocktails, no matter how long it might have taken to find just what I was looking for. Took several additional tours exploring properties that accented various points on my wish-list, and eventually circled back with renewed confidence, placing an offer on the place they originally pegged for me.

They had me totally prepared with regards to the process, financing, paperwork, etc. In the end, the seller took our offer over a higher competing bid because we were more prepared, more decisive, and easier to work with‚Äîtotally the Divas‚Äô doing. The process was simple and mostly electronic‚Äîwhich I loved. I was working full time and transitioning to a new job, car shopping, and on a vacation out of the States while all of this was going on. Despite all of that, they made it simple for me, with most of the work done on my smartphone miles away. I was literally at a gathering with friends, champagne in hand, while the Diva‚Äôs were negotiating on my behalf. Fabulous!

Beyond my own positive experience with Team Diva, I want to comment on another thing about this team that has really stood out to me since my purchase. These ladies are truly dedicated to being involved in their community. They are a standing host home to an international student group; they actively promote awesome local arts, events, businesses, and talent; and they regularly contribute to a number of important local charities and causes. They are always connecting people together for one reason or another. I really admire their ‚Äòdivalicious‚Äô contribution to the Capitol Hill community."

11038,0.2801402918069585,"Abraham is an outstanding realtor, simply the best. We (a family of four with two kids under 15) were moving from Chicago to Miami, a big deal because I have never lived anywhere else and I was nervous about picking real estate in unfamiliar territory. Abraham is a Miami native so his knowledge of neighborhoods and their development over time was extremely helpful and gave us confidence in our search and ultimate decision.

Abraham also has significant construction experience and is DIY handy which was tremendously valuable in assessing the condition of properties and estimating the costs of any updates or modifications we would need to make a property work for us. He is also shrewd negotiator. He does his research on value so you feel confident in making your offer and he fights hard to obtain the best deal for his clients.  He actually encouraged us to keep pushing for a lower price when we accepted our counter. This really spoke volumes to me about his integrity and commitment to his clients.

Abraham is that rare professional who is both type A in motivation, organization, and skill yet calm, patient, and friendly. He got us in our dream home quickly and for less than we expected. We are absolutely thrilled with our new home!

In sum, Abraham is generous, considerate, pays meticulous attention to detail and takes excellent care of his clients; a class act from start to finish. We will be going to Abraham for all of our real estate needs and I highly recommend him."

1214,0.27999999999999997,Arriagas crew is by far 10/10 recommended.. 2 moves in 3 years and they have gone above and beyond moving us. And all our Great Danes belongings. The he crew takes the time to do more than carry boxes. I am a customer to this crew for any future move.
6847,0.27999999999999997,"When i was looking for a listing agent, I interviewed many agents from Zillow to several firms and independents. One thing that struck me about Doron was that he was prepared. Often I ask the agent what they think the house could sell for...i had responses from others ranging from ""i'd ask my realestate friends"", ""lets just throw something out there and see what sticks"", ""I don't know if you go with me I will tell you"". Doron had not only dont the market analysis of the area, he also has an engineering background where he brought a series of timeseries graphs to articulate market movement, pricing, availability and the correlation between them. I think his approach was backed more by science and why I was comfortable moving forward with him.

We listed and sold within a month within 5k of what we were targeting."
224,0.27999999999999997,The service was excellent. Boris and Reed reached my place on time. They helped with moving all the things very efficiently and also helped with mantling everything back to how it was. I would definitely take their service again and highly recommend Boris and Reed!

We could not be more thrilled with the quality of service he provided which ultimately landed us a home that we absolutely love in a crazy Seattle market. Because this was our first home purchase, Geoff really took the time to ""hand hold"" us  throughout the process and support us every step of way. He was always willing & available to explain anything & everything, and answer all of our many questions - often going ABOVE & BEYOND with his answers and advice. He has a TON of knowledge & expertise and you can immediately tell he knows what he is doing!! We found ourselves always wanting his two-cents on everything because we really valued his opinion and knowledge! He offers smart and honest advice without being at all pushy or biased. He is also SUPER fast at responding no matter the time or day (huge plus!) and is extremely professional, personable, and down-to-earth. He always showed up early and was readily available to show us new listings even with very short notice. He truly made the daunting process of first time home ownership go as smoothly, quickly and stress-free as it possibly could. We HIGHLY recommend Geoff to anyone looking for an amazing, experienced agent who will be there for you 24/7."

She was always available and worked really hard to get me my new home. I highly recommend her or anyone in her group"

I appreciated that he shared his honest opinions about houses. If he thought a property was a bad investment he would say so. He‚Äôs also great at negotiating; he was able to put together a winning bid for us on the house we liked most in a competitive market he getting a clear understanding of what the seller was looking for and what other offers were on the table."

5281,0.2794817927170869,"Isa and team were amazing! We had opted to pack everything ourselves but ran out of time  before they showed up - they helped with packing everything we had left and still managed to get everything moved over and unloaded ahead of schedule. Also a shout-out to Bima for being cheerful and super helpful the entire time.

Getting a quote from the company was super easy and they were very helpful and accommodating despite needing to go back and forth a bunch to get schedules coordinated (the apartment we were moving to had very restricted elevator availability) - on the day of the move they also checked in to see if everything was going fine. Their virtual estimation was super easy to go through and quite accurate (though again thanks to Isa + the rest we came in ahead of schedule!)

Would definitely recommend Pure to anyone looking to move!"

Definitely appreciate the hard work these 2 put in that day because for a 2 person household, we had quite a bit and they were fast! Also need to note, nothing was damaged. Period.

11556,0.2792592592592593,"Geoff is highly recommended by me because he checked all the boxes. He had local knowledge, was willing to give references, explained things thoroughly given his expertise about the market and process involved. Geoff made himself available over the phone, via text and email and his responses were timely and informative. We felt very comfortable with him and his team.

10268,0.2792207792207792,"Geoff was recommended to me by a colleague/friend in 2019. I was searching for a one bedroom condo at the time. It was my first home hunting/buying experience so I had a lot to learn. I could not have asked for a better person to learn from than Geoff! Life circumstances and the uncertainty of COVID put my search on hold. I contacted Geoff again in Nov 2022, this time in need of a 2 bed/2 bath condo. Geoff remembered me and responded right away. He and his partner, Kelly Rudhe, were quick to set up tours with me every time I reached out to them. Our first offer on a unit fell through, but that was due to the budget limit I had set in the offer. In June, another unit in the same building as our previous offer opened up!  We made an offer and it was accepted (I love my new home!) As usual, Geoff communicated with me every step of the way, I learned something new from him in every interaction. I knew Geoff had my best interests at heart, he was never pushy and made sure I knew what to expect with each step. I'm forever grateful for Geoff, he's a great person who sets the bar high for realtors. His 5* rating is well earned. I recommend him to anyone looking for a realtor. Thank you, Geoff!"

AB Moving broke a lot of my items. They had a leak in their truck which resulted in most of my things being damage. They have been unresponsive and offered me hardly anything in insurance money even though I paid for full coverage. Take your business elsewhere!"

If I could give more than 5 stars, I would. They were simply the best! Highly recommended!"

When we got to my storage unit they did a great job organizing everything to make it fit well. I would definitely trust these guys with any move. Only issue is be prepared with cash, as they do not accept checks anymore. It was a bit sketchy giving all my card information on paper, but other than that the whole experience was a breeze."

2317,0.27854978354978355,"We recently used Power Loaders for our move from Miami to Orlando, and I can't recommend them enough! From start to finish, their service was exceptional and made the entire process stress-free.

The team at Power Loaders was incredibly friendly and accommodating. They patiently answered all our questions and provided a clear breakdown of the moving process, putting our minds at ease. Their professionalism and attention to detail were evident right from the initial consultation with Alvaro. It was a last minute reservation and he helped squeeze me in for the move.

On moving day, the crew arrived promptly and wasted no time getting to work. They handled our belongings with great care, ensuring everything was securely packed and protected during transit. It was evident that they treated our possessions as if they were their own.

The efficiency of the Power Loaders team was truly impressive. They worked diligently, yet efficiently, ensuring the entire process was completed in record time. This meant we could settle into our new home in Orlando without delay.

If you're planning a move, look no further than Power Loaders. They are reliable, professional, and make the entire moving experience enjoyable. We are grateful for their fantastic service and would happily recommend them to anyone in need of moving assistance.

11259,0.2785423197492164,"Luca Madori is the definition of white glove service. I had a discouraging experience working with other realtors because they were extremely unresponsive and didn‚Äôt care to advise on questions that I had. With the market being extremely hot right now in Miami, the people I was in contact with were not moving fast enough to get me through the door. I submitted an inquiry to a place on my own, and Luca responded quickly. That particular unit was already off the market, but within minutes, Luca asked me all the questions he needed in order to find me the perfect place. Luca acts fast and certainly hustles on your behalf. Luca found me literally the most perfect place for me and he had me applying within minutes. Luca made the process very easy for me and was helpful every step of the way. Since I was moving cross country, I really appreciate how attentive Luca was, and how persistent he was when dealing with the building throughout the application process. He went to the unit and facetimed me to ensure I was aligned and ready to apply. He submitted the paperwork very quickly, and provided daily updates to ensure I was in the loop every step of the way. Upon arrival to Miami, he picked me up and showed me the way to my new home. I am so excited to be in Miami because of how easy Luca made the process for me, and I absolutely love my new home.

From the moment I met Zach, he immediately took all the weight of selling  our house off my shoulders. He began answering every question I had, and even ones I had not thought of.
Our sale posed some difficult challenges. A-List handled these with patience, kindness, and kept us informed all through the process. We were even checked on regularly by Zach to make sure we were doing well.
We are extremely grateful to Zach, and A-List Properties! Everything we were told from beginning to end, is exactly what they said it would be. There were no surprises, or falsities from them. We are so proud of this incredible company!

They helped out with disposing of stuff which I'm aware a lot of folks do not help with. In my new place they put everything where I'd asked them to.

Not only was Zach extremely thoughtful and patient, but he also went above and beyond to make sure that we were comfortable and confident in our decisions. He truly made us feel like we were his top priority, and we are grateful for all of his efforts.

Kyle was equally amazing. He was always available to drop everything at a moment's notice for a house viewing and helped us evaluate each property through our criteria. His attention to detail and teamwork made the entire experience seamless and enjoyable. I would highly recommend Zach and his team to anyone in the market for a new home.

8156,0.27838296760710557,"My wife and I had the pleasure of working with Jake and Jenna to find a home this summer.  We got married in July and thought the best next step would be to look for and purchase a home, but we had some concerns around navigating this difficult housing market and with trying to find a home before our apartment lease expired.  Jake and Jenna both assured us that we would not have any problems with finding a home in that time frame which really helped to ease our concerns.  They sent us a number of listings and set up viewings that fit our schedule.  My wife and I were very picky when it came to purchasing a home which meant that we looked at A LOT of homes.  Jake and Jenna did an outstanding job with helping us keep a positive outlook and by assuring us that there was a home out there for us.  After looking at approximately 25 homes or so in a month time span, we finally found a home that we fell in love with.   They jumped into action and engaged the seller‚Äôs agent to let them know we were interested in purchasing the home.  They did an amazing job of guiding us through this process from start to finish.  They helped us with putting together our offer and by working with our lender.   They were both always available when we needed them and there were times when we sent them texts later at night.  They were always quick to respond and get back to us.  Jake also did a great job of pointing out possible flaws in the house that we should take into consideration before making any decisions.  We would definitely recommend working with them if you have a chance and we would definitely work with them again in the future.  This was as a fantastic experience and we are very happy they were able to help us find our first home!  We believe that they are the best agents in the PNW!!!!"

9178,0.2783333333333333,"Zach McDonald has been a blast to work with!  Met him by random chance at an open house of his, told him that my previous realtor was being very unresponsive, and he immediately stepped up to the plate.  Within the first few hours of meeting him, he had already set up a showing that same day with a   property that I was interested in viewing.  I was very impressed by his motivation and drive to find me the home that I wanted.  He is very quick to respond to emails, phone calls, and texts, and keeps in contact with you throughout the week, whether it's with potential properties, or just to check in and see what he can do for you.  Zach also has an awesome team alongside him.  They made the closing process fly by with ease.  He likes to surround himself with the best in the business so he can provide his clients with the best service possible.

I would definitely recommend Zach to anyone looking for a motivated realtor that actually makes the house hunting process enjoyable and simple."

10944,0.27817460317460313,"Chris, Rod, Jeremy, and Sarah were great.  In this day and age of the internet, there's no need for a full service realtor to show you homes, but Trelora will do so anyway and for a much lower cost.  We saved $13,000.  We did most of own searching via the internet and by going to open houses and when we were ready to see the few homes we narrowed down to, the Trelora team had no problems showing when we wanted.  After, they handled all of the contracts and helped us negotiate a great offer and then made sure the sale closed smoothly and on time.  We'll use them for all future sales and purchases."

Overall it was a great experience working with Abraham and he made what is normally a stressful process a smooth and easy one.  I will definitely be using Abraham for future purchases/sales and highly recommend reaching out to him if you are in the market to buy or sell."

11999,0.27795935545935546,"Marc and Claire from WaLaw Realty were amazing in the buying process. I would highly recommend.

From the moment we first initiated the buying process with them, Marc and Claire were very up front about the services that they provide and where they add unique value.

Marc is an attorney and is very detailed and patient in explaining the details and title of the home. We purchased a new construction single family home that was titled as a condo. He went through great details in explaining some of the gotchas, which ultimately helped us reach a decision in purchasing.

Through the bargaining process and we were able to get a fair price while keeping all contingencies. One area where I was particularly impressed was when the seller had failed to perform one of the items in repair list that was agreed upon. The agent's incentive is to close; however, Marc and Claire advised us to delay closing until the item was addressed even suggesting that we could walk away from the deal if they failed to perform their duty. They navigated the situation perfectly without burning bridges.

Lastly, they rebate half the buyer's commission. That saved us 10's of thousands of dollars."

Even with the uncertainty of the situation and rapidly changing information they took it all in stride and were able to help despite unknowns and my overall frazzled state.

The day of the move was great! They called to make sure I was ready and arrived promptly. Taylor and Coleman were friendly and professional. They immediately put me at ease with their expertise and the respect they showed me. Most times I feel awkward when overseeing a move but they were so friendly And efficient that I felt completely relaxed. They even made an effort to get to know me and made suggestions about furniture that would look good in my new apartment. It‚Äôs also great that you can tip with a credit/debit card instead of cash.

These two are awesome!
10455,0.27760942760942764,"I didn't have to meet a lot of agents before deciding to go with Danny. He is as professional as you can get in a realtor-- he understands the Seattle market well and knows how tough it is for buyers-- something I found out quickly!

What I liked about Danny is that I never felt pressured to put an offer on homes that I didn't feel 100% on. Furthermore, I felt comfortable driving the offer process with Danny... I am a pretty risk adverse individual so I'm glad that we were able to put in a loaded offer for the condo that I am now under contract for.

I didn't think that I would be moving into a new place by the end of July, and so this beats my expectation. As a first-time home buyer, I am glad that I have gone with a professional who is very responsive, honest, and knowledgeable. Thank you so much Danny!"

The difference between a small, well run, family business and the huge companies is astounding.  Everyone we interacted with was friendly and professional.  They treat you like neighbors who they are helping out.  In addition, they are fast, efficient, flexible and take good care of your stuff.  We interviewed several moving companies ahead of the move and the choice was clear when we compared services and prices.  In retrospect, there is really no comparison when you think about the level of service these guys offer.  So good to know that companies like this still exist."
7627,0.2770833333333333,Absolutely 100% highly recommended!!! They were early and worked very efficiently. They wrapped all the furniture. I am very satisfied with their services. Very affordable as well.
1278,0.2770833333333333,"My partner and I have used Eco Movers twice now for moving apartments in Seattle. This time, we had the opportunity to upgrade apartments in our building, but we needed a pretty quick turnaround time for the move. I was able to call Eco Movers on a Thursday and schedule the move for the following Tuesday. Our moving team was Netzer and Tony, they were super friendly and helpful. They came in, assessed the inventory (which I had forgotten to update online, oops), made a plan for how to move everything in the fewest elevator trips, then started loading the elevator. Netzer ended up saving me a bit of money as well, I had ordered the mattress bag but since we were just traveling in an elevator, he suggested wrapping it in the moving blankets instead and removed the bag from my bill. Our move was quoted at the minimum 4 hour estimate, but Netzer and Tony finished everything up in 2.5 hours so our overall bill was less than we planned for, which is always nice.

We chose them because of our good experience last time, and again this time we had a smooth booking process and a frictionless moving experience."

BA Florida Properties has been managing our landscaping for the past month and we couldn't be more satisfied with the level of service. Brandy has been very easy to reach to answer any questions, and all of the transactions have been very transparent and clear. The landscaper is very thorough and considerate of my yard and does a wonderful job. I look forward to continue giving them business and referring my neighbors, friends, and family."

Thank you, Jose and JP!"
11760,0.27690070346320345,"Geoff is the only real estate agent I‚Äôll ever work with in the area going forward. If you‚Äôre reading this review, call him. He is punctual, professional, and responsive.

He found me an amazing investment opportunity, and I was able to avoid a bidding war because my new property wasn‚Äôt on any realtor MLS. That saved me about 100k, and is just one example of Geoff putting thousands of my dollars towards my home instead of someone else's pocket.

I had put buying a house off for too long because I wanted something in the Hyde Park area in Tampa, but I wasn‚Äôt interested in the headaches that come with the territory as a buyer in this market.

My home has tremendous airbnb revenue potential, which can be intimidating without the right resources. Geoff is a business partner. He‚Äôs more like a consultant that has business, marketing, and unique strategies.

Here is an example of why I‚Äôm writing this review: Geoff saved me more time today, after my transaction is already complete, than this review will take me to type out.

Don‚Äôt just pick a friend or a neighbor because they‚Äôre nice. Pick Geoff."

By taking his advice for how to approach selling a home and using his recommended vendors and partners to avoid issues. He got the siblings $50k more than another cash offer from another investor. He was patient, professional, and emphatic when needed and a pit bull when necessary to maximize getting them more money. The siblings tried selling on their own and not only would have received less but their interests weren't being protected.

A few days before our move, I still hadn't booked anyone and was frantically calling the best rated movers I could find on Yelp.  Most of them were expensive, and others were already booked.  I started to panic, and that's when I decided to e-mail AM Moving company to see if they had any availability.  Lucky for me, they did!  Again, they responded quickly, and said they had an opening at 9am.  I replied back immediately to book the time.  They again responded right away with a confirmation.  They also offered the best rate ($95 per hour, 3 men, 3 hour minimum, $40 fuel charge) compared to all the other companies ($100-$125 per hour) I had called.  The day of our move, I received a call from Miguel letting me know that they were a few minutes away.  They arrived right at 9am.  As soon as Roman walked into our apartment, he noticed all of our brand new boxes.  He gave me a tip and told me to check Craigslist next time because people are always giving away free boxes!  The guys were all very friendly, they worked fast, were extremely careful with all of our belongings, and were very sweet to my 4 year old daughter.  I was so nervous about the move, but am so happy that we got a great team to help us.  We are only here for 6 months while we build our house and will be moving again.  I made sure to get their business cards and names before they left so that I can request them again in November.  These guys were amazing!  You won't be disappointed!  Be sure to request ROMAN, MIGUEL AND FREDDIE!!!!  They will take great care of you!"

I would highly recommend Nick to anyone looking for an apartment or home. I look forward to having him help us again when we are looking to buy a house.

Nick is very knowledgeable, professional, and organized. We corresponded via phone, e-mail and text to clarify what my wife and I were looking for in an apartment so that he could come up with a list of properties to show us during a short 1 day apartment hunting expedition we had planned.

On a Saturday morning, my wife and I flew out to Dallas from NYC hopeful but realistic in our expectations thinking that at most we might be able to find some properties that we could put on a list to consider. When we met Nick, both my wife and I were impressed by his organization skills, and efficient manor. After a short chat to narrow down our preferences and go over some of the properties that had availabilities, Nick drove us on an apartment hunting mission.

During our apartment search, Nick was very courteous and knowledgeable in explaining Uptown Dallas to us two newbies from NYC. He had a great handle on what we were looking for and what properties with availabilities would suit our preferences. We ended up finding a great place for a great price within only a few hours of landing in Dallas all thanks to Nick's help!

I tend to ask a lot of questions and be a very outspoken and wordy person at times, especially when it comes to big decisions like a residence. Nick was always very patient, candid, and knowledgeable in his decisions. We really appreciate Nick's help in finding us our home in Dallas, and we highly recommend him to anyone looking to do the same!

Thanks, Nick!"

She was able to easily explain the home-buying process and help us set expectations. During one of the hottest housing markets in recent memory, Kayla helped us remain calm, assemble some killer offers, and eventually find a home that we truly fell in love with. She also really worked to build an amazing rapport with every one of the listing agents we reached out to, which was a massive help. Highly recommend an experience with her!

They swooped in and moved like a well-oiled machine, taking care of everything and even finishing packing up our (very overloaded) kitchen. Then they came in and put everything exactly where we asked them to. And the entire time, they were often smiling, making jokes with each other, and all around being good-natured despite the grueling work.

At my request, she even went the extra mile to coordinate some retrofitting, including wall painting, installing LVP flooring, and addressing the cap between the new floors and baseboards. She was so warm and dedicated, helping me find the right team to complete these tasks.

I've worked with her on a number of housing transactions in Seattle, as both a seller and a buyer, and relied on her expertise and guidance every step of the way. Johnine knows more about Seattle real estate than any other realtor in the area, and goes above and beyond to help her clients feel secure and confident in the process. She is also extremely well respected in the real estate community, which is beyond helpful when negotiating with other agents. I've been impressed when Johnine has steered me away from purchases when it wasn't in my best interest, even if meant she had to work harder to find me something else. I always felt her personal investment and that she truly wants her clients to be happy with their sale or purchase. Johnine has set the bar exceedingly high, and there's no other realtor I'd work with in the Seattle area. Hands down, she's the best. Hire her, you won't regret it."

Brooks and Levi arrived within the agreed time slot. They surveyed the boxes and furniture, then proceeded to pad and wrap all of the furniture. They thoughtfully staged moving the items onto the truck, which went quickly.
When they arrived at the new apartment, Brooks and Levi figured out a good way to work with the restrictions of the only available elevator. They efficiently brought all of the items in, including a very bulky and heavy chair.
Brooks and Levi did a great job. I will keep Wildcat Movers in mind whenever I need to move again."

11315,0.27407140184917955,"The hardest part about writing a review of Geoff is toning it down so that you don't think I was paid to write it. Here is the thing though, he is really the absolute best and has helped us with three different properties as our family's needs have changed. In 2012, my wife and I had the pleasure of working with Geoff to both sell our condo and find a house for our growing family.  Geoff was able to help us through the short sale process on the condo (we would have been lost without him).  The short sale process was lengthy as it seems that the banks love taking their sweet time, but Geoff stayed in constant contact keeping us informed.  Finding a new home was a much speedier process.  We talked with Geoff about what we wanted in a house, where we would like to be, and how much we could afford.  Then we were off looking at houses.  He really got us and the second house we looked at was the one for us.  Geoff helped us keep looking around just to be sure and when we were ready Geoff helped us close on our first real house! After a few years of equity and a couple of kids, Geoff helped us sell and buy up to something bigger and better for our family.  Going in, Geoff let us know how much the market changed since our last purchase (great for anyone trying to sell, but rough for people looking to buy). That is why when a house came on the market that really got us excited, Geoff offered to come to the open house with us. He also made sure we checked out a few other comparable homes on the market nearby to make sure we found The One. It was so we called Geoff and he put together our offer and had it submitted before the open house was finished. We were in contract (for list price!) by the end of that weekend. Without Geoff I am sure that we would have paid more or worse missed out on our home entirely. Beyond being really good at the whole buying and selling houses thing, Geoff is incredibly approachable, responsive and all around pleasant person to be around. We are still so impressed with how professional he is and so personable.  Simply, we really trust and like him as a person. He is prompt with his communication, helped so much in making sure we asked the right questions during all parts of the process (during the inspection, appraisal, etc), and really just wants the best for his clients.  We would recommend him to anyone needing to sell their home or find the perfect next house!"

This was our second home purchase over the last few years and we were moving in from out of state for new jobs, and it was excellent to have someone as knowledgeable about the Seattle area as Kelly. He gave us great insight on different Seattle communities, towns, and amenities that we wouldn‚Äôt have had otherwise. We appreciated the knowledge that a true Seattle local brought to our search.

Kelly didn‚Äôt pressure us to stretch our budget, and came into offers with our best interest as a priority. He provided valuable insight into the expected sale price of a home to guide us to make competitive offers. We had a short term rental, and when the lease was closing in on its renewal date, Kelly didn‚Äôt pressure or rush us into making offers. He truly had our best interests in mind.

Kelly was always very responsive, and he made himself available whenever we needed him (eg we had several midnight texts and calls as we got offers ready several times).

Overall Kelly was excellent and we would highly recommend him to anyone looking for their next home who wants an expert who will treat them as a priority."

Our purchase went smoothly and in record time. We contacted Chris again in March 2022 as the time had come for us to move on and sell the property. Chris introduced us to Doron Weisbarth who carried out a detailed explanation about all aspects involved in the sale of the property. Both, Chris and Doron guided us through the process and suggested all actions needed to sell our property at the most competitive price. Laura, their assistant, participated later in placing all the required signs on the property to have at hand clear information for potential buyers. The 3 of them were professional, caring, attentive, knowledgeable, and with a touch of sincere interest in obtaining the best deal.

I described my ideal home and then he showed me exactly what I wanted to see. His service went above and beyond. When I chose the condo I wanted, I felt confident that he would do everything he could to close the deal for me, and he did.

Highly recommended!"
10014,0.27298850574712646,"Sage transcends expectations, making first time home buyers like my wife and I feel as though we're his only clients. From the initial consultation we were convinced Sage not only had the experience, credentials and desire to help us find the best possible home we could afford but we also knew we could put our trust in him completely. We were rewarded for our faith in Sage as he led us through each showing providing valuable insight into what we needed to be aware of with each property as well as being fully prepared with comps to help us understand the true value of each listing.

As promised, Sage was ready to guide us through the process of ""winning"" the deal when we had decided on the home we now own. He crafted the offer and expertly set the timeline putting us in the best position to make our bid come across as serious and fair. I will not attempt to portray our experience as typical in Seattle's extremely hot market, however thanks to Sage we did win the deal and got the home we wanted (which was also the first home we bid on) below list. Sage prepped us with his thorough comps so we knew we were already getting our home below the market value, which kept us from putting forth an offer too low to be taken seriously.

Sage is sincere, exceptionally professional, and has a fantastic sense of humor which serves him well but more importantly it will serve you well if you are fortunate enough to enlist him as your agent."

My wife and I just bought our first house with him and I really couldn't be happier! Normal realtors just ""go the extra mile"", but Chris would go many many more extra miles to give you that edge over other offers in a competitive market. This guy would literally write an offer anytime and anywhere, in record time and that ""first mover advantage"" is what gets you the house. We started knowing nothing about the process of buying a house, but he helped and made us comfortable in every step. He will also give you great advice regarding pretty much anything real estate. If you are still reading this, you've definitely found the right guy. Scroll up, and make sure you give him a call/email and you won't regret it!"

Geoff held our hands every step of the way whenever we needed him to, gave us honest and non-pushy advice and explained the entire process by laying out all of the information step by step for us throughout. He never pressured us to make a rash decision and truly acted as a mentor/guidance when it came to home buying. He and his staff were always ready and available to show us any properties we wanted to see, and were also very responsive via email, phone, and text pretty much all hours of the day. Geoff stayed on top of all of our paperwork, dates, you name it... The first time buying process was a piece of cake and we're super happy! Thank you Geoff!"

11810,0.2703205128205128,"Sage at LacMont Realty Group is efficient, professional, thorough, and kind when it comes to the home-buying process, and my partner and I feel very fortunate to have worked with Sage in the purchase of our first home. As at-the-time prospective home owners, my partner and I interviewed several realtors and toured homes with them. Sage stood out for the following reasons:

1. He was quick and thorough at responding in his communication, which clearly demonstrated his responsiveness and efficiency. He was also very thorough when it came to inspecting homes with us. He  pointed out details that we never would have noticed on our own, such as the noise-level of the dishwasher that was installed.
2. Sage met us where we were at as first-time prospective home owners by balancing educating us as first time home buyers and keeping us focused on task, which led us to feeling knowledgable and confident about our decisions without feeling overloaded. Even though Sage must have seen hundreds (or more) homes, he shared in our first-time-home-owner-excitement.
3. He provided honest feedback as to whether he thought places were ""worth it"" and ran comparisons with other comparable homes in the area to support his viewpoints.
4. When we walked into the home we now own, Sage was able to pull together a competing offer that day, and he made it clear what we needed to ""win."" We won. ;)
5. Post-closing on the home, Sage went above and beyond by staying in touch, and connected us to some folks in his network, such as a general contractor, who helped us finesse our home further.

My partner and I have recommended Sage to all of our friends, family, and colleagues as he surpasses all expectations."

My team of Alejandro and David were amazing! Mine was a simplistic move, but I could tell they had the tools and knowledge for any last minute planning or bumps in the road. Their truck was well equipped for any kind of furniture. The wardrobe boxes were huge life savers for my miscellaneous bags I couldn't fit anywhere.

Highly recommended!
Everything from first contact, to office support to a fast and excellent packing crew, to the hard working movers was smooth and efficient and helped me to come in under the estimate.

Shelly listened to my needs and began searching for my new home. I came into town and spent the day with Shelly to tour properties that suited my needs. Shelly was well organized, knew all the specifics of each property and extremely efficient. Her knowledge of the areas we toured helped me to make a confident decision and we found my new home the very same day and I was able to get back to packing and feeling excited about my move. Shelly still continues to follow up with me and has made this transition very smooth. I highly recommend Shelly Nelms as your Realtor if you are looking to make a move!

A few years later we purchased a second home in the Central District and subsequently sold it through Team Diva in 2014. Through every transaction Kim and Chavi worked with us to find a house that fit our needs and our personalities. Most recently, when my father passed away unexpectedly, Team Diva connected us to an awesome real estate agent in the South Sound who helped us handle the sale of my father‚Äôs home.

I interviewed several agents and have no regrets in my decision to go with Kelly Byrne and his firm Blue Pacific Real Estate. Kelly is very personable, an excellent communicator, and a true expert about the Seattle real estate market.  He provided me with a level of personal attention that I doubt I would have experienced had I gone with a budget, or with one of the larger, agencies. He assembled the perfect team of professionals to help prepare my home for sale. As a result, I received multiple offers for my home and it sold quickly, far above the asking price. Kelly then helped me search for, and make a winning offer on, my next home. Working with Kelly was an absolute pleasure. I highly recommend him for any residential real estate transaction!"

These gentlemen were just terrific throughout it all: efficient, careful, and, best of all, hilarious! I don't like moving but I do like to laugh :D. Oh, and when I got a flat, they were awesome--offered to unload my car and put on the spare for me (I asked them to keep moving while I took care of it :D), talked through different options, just as a friend would do--totally willing to accommodate me. They insisted on checking my spare at the end to make sure I'd be safe on the road! What a great team...efficient, careful, and caring.

No worry about cleaning carpets, etc while moving out as they had the house professionally cleaned, took care of staging set up (which was amazing), professional pictures along with two open houses.

He‚Äôs genuine caring nature throughout the process of selling my home from getting it ready to list and to the day of my move out was outstanding. Of course, his ability to get multiple  top-notch offers within the first 2 days of going on the market during what is considered a slowing down period because of the holidays was remarkable.

With monthly updates and detailed step-by-step videos for each step in house buying, it makes so much easier for new home buyers like us to understand the process thoroughly. He was very clear on first step as getting pre-approval which proved to be really important in our case (TRUST the process!!).  If you are someone like us who want very transparent communication, Zach and his team(Rachel and Lindsay) is the right choice for you. Our visits were properly scheduled, all safety precautions were taken amidst covid pandemic and never had any issues around it. He provided his honest opinion on each house we visited, laid out the pros and cons which really helped us to make a call. We had previously experienced how the agents created a pressurized situation to make a quick/hasty decision but house buying is probably the most expensive investment you are going to make. There was literally NO‚Ä¶NADA..NIL.. pressure from Zach to make a decision on any house we saw with him. Regular check-ins on Tuesday and Thursday make the whole process seamless as he breaks down each step for you and share latest updates for your case. On top of everything, he recommended Dan Keller from Cross Country  Mortgage who helped us close the house in less than 21 days with very competitive interest rates. Zach and Dan makes a great team if you are looking for quick closures.

THE FUN PART: Hands down, Zach and team are really passionate for their work. Closing on a house with Zach is an experience, why? That‚Äôs because the gestures this team makes  to make it special for you. For us, sending card when you start the house buying process, another one when you put the down escrow money and last on closure. The best part, they come with cookies :) Finally on the closing days, Zach got food with Champagne, along with few gifts and an awesome welcome home video to save our memories for lifetime.

Zach will be our go-to agent in future as well, we wish him great success in his business! Thank you Zach and Team, looking forward to do more business with you in future."

5001,0.26785714285714285,"Gamez and Jaben were awesome.  Guys were precisely on time, careful, helpful and understanding.  There was also no ""surprise charge"" that many movers make after the fact other than the extra time which is also reasonable."
11226,0.2677083333333333,"Hannah is a total rockstar and I got very lucky to have her represent me as my agent! Hannah and Kim both took the time to understand me as a buyer and tailored the search and process to fit my needs and style - this made the process of buying a home out-of-state much smoother and it built a solid foundation of trust. I know I can rely on Hannah‚Äôs judgment when I‚Äôm not there in person to look at homes, and it‚Äôs been an immense help. Very happy with how things turned out and the collective knowledge and resources the diva team provided, they‚Äôre my go-to for future endeavors."
2005,0.2675736961451247,"This was our first time ever using professional movers and we weren't sure what to expect. I have to say I will forever use this crew for our moving needs. Frank, Frankie, and Eric busted their tails all day and made sure every single piece of our belongs was handled with care. Hands down an amazing experience!"
10517,0.26752645502645506,"Danny was an amazing help in the purchase of our first home in Seattle. It took us about 9 months, 20-30 viewings, and 3 total offers until we found the right home. He was always available and ready to help.

During one of the early viewings, we were overly excited about a house that was at the very top of our budget, but he talked some sense into us (undesirable location, overbuilt for the block, not as great as we thought upon closer inspection), and we're so glad he did. Plus he earned our trust - a quick sale at the top of our budget would've made things easy for him - but he was watching out for our financial interests.

He set us up with a great mortgage broker, inspectors, and he helped us every step of the way with a quick answer to every question at any hour.

We actually placed the offer on our home remotely (while out of the country), because it was peak listing season and we found a home that fit all of our criteria. We had a 3D tour, pictures, and Danny set up a video chat with us, walking through the home with an inspector, and sent us all of the documents needed digitally.  We had seen enough houses with Danny, and he knew what we were looking for in a house, so we trusted his opinion. A little crazy... but it worked, and we're really happy with the house. Thanks Danny!"

1452,0.26749999999999996,"Best moving experience by far! The movers were set to arrive between 8-10, and they were parked and officially started the move by 8:19. They were communicative and accommodated a few changes during the move. It took them 3 hours to move most of the things from my 1br apt to storage, including disassembling a few furniture pieces. They also packed my storage unit beautifully, with all the big things at the back so I can access the boxes as needed. I‚Äôll definitely use them again when I move out of the storage unit!"

As first time homebuyers in the crazy Seattle market, Ryan was always available to help us navigate the emotional ups and downs of this new to us process. During the endeavor it was uniquely helpful to be able to consult with the affiliated GHAH contracting team (who we eventually hired and had a wonderful experience with). We are so happy to have landed in an amazing home in our dream neighborhood, and would highly recommend working GHAH and especially Ryan to any other first time homebuyers!"
9214,0.26721763085399447,"Selling (or buying) a home always seems like a daunting undertaking, but Judy made our experience easy and gratifying: easy since she took charge of many preparatory details, from repair work and painting to staging and overall presentation; gratifying since she brought in an offer well above asking price almost from the get-go. We were able to follow progress on the deal from our new home several hundred miles away, and to know that our old one was in good hands both with Judy and the new owners."
5102,0.2671428571428572,Absolutely flawless experience all around. The team was professional and fast. Every piece of furniture was wrapped and not a single item was damaged during the move. 100% will use Phoenix for any future moves.
9964,0.2670899470899471,"Let's face it, moving is a pain. We've all moved at least once, and unless you have money to burn and can have someone come in and - sort, pack, load and unload - it's time consuming and stressful. Enter Wildcat Movers their team provided excellent service for our recent move. Edwin and Osman arrived on time and quickly got to work, carefully packing and loading all of our belongings onto the truck. They were efficient and professional throughout the entire process and made sure to handle everything with great care.

I was particularly impressed that the operations manager Dalton showed up to check on the team and not only that but jumped in to help with a couple of large items. And more unexpectantly Zane, the owner of Wildcat Movers, even came by and chatted for a bit.

Overall, I would highly recommend Wildcat Movers to anyone in need of a reliable and trustworthy moving company. They took a lot of the stress and worry out of my move, and made the whole process as smooth and hassle-free as possible. Thank you Wildcat Movers!"

He was very understanding of my difficult situation and strategized the most effective to get the house on the market.  He helped to create efficient an timeline, coordinated staging, contractors, repair, landscaping, and photographer.  We were able to get the house under contract within 1 week of listing and closed early. I valued Justin‚Äôs area of expertise, excellent service, and efficiency.  He has gone above and beyond to help me and my family.  I couldn‚Äôt asked for me super-agent than him."
11782,0.26676319176319174,"We were introduced to Kelly through our mortgage broker, as we wanted our agent and financing folks to be able to work closely together. After interviewing a few agents we felt most comfortable with Kelly because of the impression he gave us of integrity, honesty, responsiveness, and knowledge/expertise. Our needs were to find a bigger house for our growing family to move into, which depended on the contingent sale of our current house. In the home search process he provided great insight that helped us avoid some potential headaches, and once we found the house that we really liked he went all-in for us and provided multitudes of great advice and unbiased guidance which always had our best interests at the forefront. Our transactions had to move very quick (we first met Kelly in mid October and closed on both sale and purchase in early December) and it became very evident through this process that Kelly possesses an immense amount of expertise and intuition with the inner workings of real estate transactions. He kept us on track, communicated prudently, honestly, and often, and from our perspective we didn't really have a single hiccup throughout the whole ordeal. He 100% had our back in the buying process, and with the help of his team also got us more than our asking price on the selling side which we obviously were quite pleased about. I cannot properly convey the amount of respect my wife and I have for Kelly. We feel fortunate that we got connected with him. He conducts his business with a distinct amount of professionalism that is rare in the real estate world. There are inherent aspects of the real estate market that can and cannot be controlled, and Kelly is a master of the things he can control and is honest and forthright with those that he cannot. Strongly recommend working with him."

The inspector they referred was super detailed, which is important when purchasing older homes, his findings helped us in negotiations. They were really fast at getting things checked off and moving on.  Rod jumped in when Chris was out for something right away, no moment of silence.  I will be reaching out shortly again if I decide to list my previous home.

10122,0.2666666666666667,"Christina Corona was my realtor and a pleasure to work with. Having to move suddenly from NYC to Miami in the middle of Corona Virus restrictions made for what should have been an exceptionally challenging experience, but she made it easy on me. She clearly communicated every step of the way, was quick and courteous in replies, and advocated on my behalf with both the landlord and the building's management. I was able to get screened, approved, and moved in extremely quickly. I absolutely plan to call Christina and her team when I go to purchase a unit and would recommend the same to anyone else!"

3415,0.26666666666666666,"Excellent work moving my items.  However, BEWARE!!  The company has made no effort to secure their clients' financial information. No DocuSign or printed documents so you can't see what you're signing after the move. You are signing on the employee's cell phone in a signature box.  Also, no credit card scanners attached to the phone. Workers must manually input your credit card and debit card information. This resulted in a fraudulent purchase within 4 hours of the team leaving. They used my credit card for two Door Dash orders totaling more than $200. Filed credit card fraud complaint with local law enforcement."

Everything from initiating an estimate to the day of services for the move, everyone has been delightful and transparent in providing clear guidance. Their pricing in my opinion is fair and affordable. Your service was most appreciated. A million thanks for everything!"
8210,0.2666141266141266,"I highly recommend Matt and team to anyone looking to sell their home. He is demonstrably most interested in doing what is necessary to get the best outcome for his client.
I initially met with Matt in July 2017, after I had been trying for months to decide how much work I should do on my condo before listing it. After meeting with half a dozen realtors and a contractor, I was about the throw in the towel and just stay put, against my deep desire to transition away from downtown living. The advice from realtors was all over the place and the contractor wanted a fortune to update only a portion of the condo. The resident manager put me in touch with a contractor who had done beautiful work in the building, Ramiro. When Ramiro and I met he led me to Matt, who was the design genius behind several successful remodels that led to impressive sales prices in the building.
When I met with Matt, I felt he truly understood what needed to be done to get the best return on my investment. He also recommended we plan to be ready for the optimum selling season in 2018, putting his potential commission off almost a year. He agreed to design and manage the project, using his experience and discounts to make the project affordable and the aesthetic right for our target audience, which wasn‚Äôt me!  In the end the project was a little late and little over budget (within acceptable margins for a project of this magnitude). We did the whole condo for same amount a previous contractor had wanted to do about 60% of the work. The outcome was beautiful, and the condo sold for exactly my target price just as the market was slowing down a bit in mid-June 2018. So I feel really lucky that I found Matt when I did, the timing was perfect and he was the perfect match for me. He developed his team as we were working together and they all pitched in and helped, from design to being there to get the stagers up the elevator, since I was living in Bremerton during the remodel.
I think this all demonstrates that Matt knows the market, puts his clients first, and he really cares. I was spoiled by his service. While I found a realtor on the other side of the sound that did a fabulous job helping me find a new home, she is not helping me with my remodel (which of course is not in her job description). I miss having another resource to lean on and guide me."
9260,0.2664822567783094,"Everyone at Evo Movers, from the customer support staff, to the local dispatchers to the movers were absolutely amazing!

I had booked a move for this Wednesday, but at the very start of the month I had to reschedule it for next Sunday because of travel changes, managed to secure the slot on the call, and a new estimate pronto. Yesterday afternoon I received news that I had to return home, and within an hour of my call, I had secured I spot for this morning, without price changes! (Thank you Trevor, Daryl and Trevor for the help here).

Today at just a quarter past 8, the team of movers was here, immediately unloaded and behan packing everything up! A two bedroom apartment, that had been quoted to take 8h to pack and move, took 5! They inventoried and safely stored everything, moving it out of the apartment and into their own storage. Even helped me reinforce some of my own packing to be more secure! (Thank you Boris, Eli, and Mario for being absolutely amazing).

No issues at all, quick, friendly, and professional! Would both recommend and use again (likely will do so in a few months once I'm back)."

11857,0.2661507936507937,"Matt and Ian helped us purchase our home in Bothell and sell our townhouse in Leschi in 2021, and we couldn't recommend them enough! They were professional every step of the way, fun to work with, and always seemed to know what we wanted (sometimes before we knew what we wanted). They are wizards at transforming and modernizing older homes and have the resources and team to make that happen. This allowed us to feel confident in buying a home that we knew without a little sweat equity would easily be out of our price range. Our home in Bothell was built in the 70's and needed reno work and Matt and Ian helped us envision what the place could be, guided us through the buying process, and played an active role throughout the entire project. When it came to selling our Leschi home, our priorities were to sell it as quickly as possible at the best possible price. Matt and Ian helped work some magic to get it sold in an off market deal at a price we were very happy with. I'd be remiss if I also didn't mention Medardo, who is a general contractor on the team, who project managed and drove much of the renovation efforts in both houses. Many thanks to the Get Happy team and we highly recommend them to future buyer/sellers!"

We had to push pause on our house hunt a couple times this past year, not once did we feel any pressure to start looking again until we were ready. They are definitely in it for the long relationship which made us more comfortable taking the time we needed to find our perfect home. They were extremely clear about what we needed to do in the home buying process and they were actually able to help us close early on our home! We also appreciated Kyle touring houses with us and informing us of some urgent house repairs and what to look out for. We never felt out of the loop in communication as well.

This move was a new team and a different experience. This move happened this month, and they were so, so slow. They said they could take all 5 of my TV's but I had to have the original box, or I could buy boxes from them for $22 each. I told the team leader that I did not have to do that last year, I told him the tv's were wrapped in plastic and blankets. He then told me that they are ""not allowed"" to unplug/plug electronics. He said If I wanted for them to disconnect anything it will be $25.00 PER ITEM/occurrence. so if they were to disconnect and connect my washer and dryer it would have been an additional $100!! which is something that I did not have to do last year. The few times I have spoken to the people who set up appointments have been pleasant."

Victor and Jos√© arrived to my apartment building about 15 minutes early. They got right to work moving my belongings and furnishings out of my second floor, walk-up studio apartment. They literally ran some of the time! Despite working amazingly quickly, they were also gentle with my stuff, wrapping the furniture and handling the boxes I'd labeled ""delicate"" with care. They worked just as quickly and carefully when they got to my new building. I really appreciated how they placed all the boxes labeled ""Kitchen"" in or near my kitchen. Victor also asked me which room I wanted the furnishings in and then made sure they got to the right room. My whole move was done in 3.5 hours. Two big thumbs up for Victor and Jos√©!

I also had a great experience booking my move with Michael via Yelp, which is how I found Magic Moving. I also appreciated the helpful person I spoke to in the office when I called about a week before my move to make sure everything was in order -- it was! I felt like I was in good hands the whole time.

I would definitely recommend Magic Moving and re-hire them myself. It's hard to find such great service, especially at such a fair and reasonable price. Thank you!"

11230,0.264765625,"Geoff Hill is an outstanding Real Estate Agent! He is nothing short of professional and knowledgeable of his industry AND he is a very patient man! A few years ago (yes, I said years) my husband and I started talking about buying our first home. As we tentatively began exploring our options, Geoff talked with us about what we were looking for and began showing us a few homes. He did not pressure us but let us do things at our own pace making himself available when we needed him. We put the home buying on hold to plan our wedding, get married and start our family - Geoff was in touch and available to us the entire time! Just 3 months ago we decided we had really outgrown our little home and were seriously ready to buy! Not only was Geoff ready and available to assist us he was extremely flexible and accommodating to our schedule. We had only looked at a couple of houses when we found the perfect one. Geoff was SO efficient! As soon we decided to make an offer he began drawing up the paperwork and we were able to submit it within a couple of hours! As first time home buyers we had no idea what we were doing and what to expect. Geoff helped us every step of the way, explaining various things that we needed to be aware of and reassuring us as we dove into this amazing endeavor. When we ran into problems with our lender and thought that we may lose the house, Geoff stepped up and handled the situation with the professionalism, assertiveness and ease that were necessary to help make things happen. We are now settling into the perfect house that we can call our VERY OWN home. Thank you, Geoff Hill!!

Geoff and his partner Kelly spent an incredible amount of time educating us and were extremely patient as we looked at lots of houses, figuring out what we wanted. Geoff was super responsive - without his lightning fast responses and offer preparation there is no way we could have overcome our indecisiveness to be quick enough to compete in this market.

11290,0.26340579710144935,"Working with Zach was great.

We needed to both sell and buy a house and before we ever committed to doing this, Zach consulted with us on our options and the different challenges we would face given the market at the time in early January 2020 (current market inventory, how buyers will view contingency at different times of the year, how he manages the full experience). This conversation gave us confidence that the time of the year was most advantageous given we would be on contingency. When we did decide move forward, Zach was immediately communicative and helped us to get connected across the board (loan companies he has had success with, how to setup a contingent offer for a quick close, more information about the area we were hoping to find a house in).

Zach makes sure that his customers have a good idea of what to expect throughout the buying process. Part of this was weekly follow ups on how we were feeling about the process, about anything we were looking at, or especially later in the process, when under contract, updates on where his team is at with working with the other buyers and sellers to get everything sorted out. We didn't feel like we were caught off guard throughout the process which was important given the number of things that needed to happen in a short period in market where houses can go in 3 days.

Last thing I would note is Zach has integrity and we were comfortable trusting him to get us through the process. There a lot of people with ""real estate licenses"" (read with air quotes) and Zach is a professional who understands the level of effort needed to offer a good experience for a huge life decision.

I would recommend Zach to anyone I know."

9709,0.26325757575757575,"I moved from Dallas Texas to Las Vegas Nevada at the end of 2019, I researched on the internet as well as asking my colleagues from my workplace to choose a moving company, in the end Phoenix Express is the one I chose and it was great! My criteria:
1. Great reputation and quality
2. Fixed price, no surprises
3. Fixed dates, move and deliver on the promised dates
4. Competitive price
5. Able to ship one car, me and my wife drove the other

PhoEnix Express has great reviews, and I noticed they replied the reviews, which shows that they do care about their reputation. I talked to three companies with good reviews, one company wouldn't give the fix price until it weights the truck, so I crossed that one. The second company gave me the fixed price, but they said my stuff could be delivered in between 4 to 10 days(Van Lines, more than one family shared the same truck), so I crossed that one too. Beau from Phoenix Express gave me the fixed price, he promised to load everything in the morning in two hours, and he brought in more than 10 people(including the owner Jeff and his wife and son) that day(12/26) and they did it.  Beau promised to deliver on 12/28 late afternoon, and they arrived early at noon. A couple of weeks of unpacking, I found only one broken wine glass, and that's my packing issue.  The owner Jeff participated the move, I found him to be a very decent person, he tried his best to satisfy our requests, and they were so careful to handle every box and every piece of the furniture. Highly recommended!"

Congruently Kim and Claire provided their insight during the showings and inspection process, able to react swiftly enough to accommodate my hectic and unusual schedule. This is definitely the kind of team you want to have on your side.

5223,0.2626071428571429,Moving is never fun but Pure Movers made our moving day as hassle free as possible. Andy and his crew kept me updated on their arrival and progress as well as asking where things should be during the unloading process. They wrapped everything up really nicely to ensure that all of our furniture and belongings weren't damaged as well as unassembled and reassembled things like our bed frame. Their prices are really fair and the crew was very friendly too. I'd highly recommend Pure Movers for your moving needs. I know we will contacting them again next time we need to move.
7304,0.26260212418300655,"My wife and I are from Florida, and wanted to purchase our first home. We had next to no knowledge of the process and were completely unprepared for the fast, competitive Seattle real estate market. We were really lucky that we were directed to Christy through Zillow‚Äôs website. She video conferenced with my husband and myself to see what we wanted and needed, and what our next steps should be to even have a chance in this market. We got our paperwork in order, selected a handful of houses that we were interested in, and they were all off market before we even had a chance to view them! Unsurprised and undeterred, Christy told us this was the market and to keep searching so we did! We narrowed down three houses we loved and Christy got us a viewing ASAP. She met with us well into the evening and drove all the way into the next county for us and by the next morning we decided to make the offer. Christy helped us put together a competitive offer that stood out and won us our home, all in all everything happened within a month. Christy was knowledgeable, helpful, friendly and confident! Whenever we outgrow this home, we are going to Christy again because we know she will fight for us.Thank you to Christy and everyone who helped, my husband and I are officially unpacked and settled and super happy to be first time home owners!"

Originally it was set up to be a 1-4 time slot, but I called and asked for a morning slot and without hesitation was given it.  Movers, as always, were great.

He walked us through every step starting with the various ways to analyze an investment property, estimating repair costs, listing the rental and even screening tenants. Once we had an offer accepted, he and his amazing mortgage broker kept us informed every step of the way. We honestly could not have done this without him. Real estate investing seemed so daunting until we met Michael. In addition to his unparalleled expertise in his field, he is just an all-around, genuinely good human. We will not hesitate to use him again in the future as we continue to build our portfolio!"

It was a long process for us because we were looking for something specific and our agent was exceptional. Agents we worked with before Redfin were a bit pushier than I like. Since Redfin has a different payment structure, looking at houses with a Redfin agent is more like looking at a house with a very knowledgeable friend. Highly recommend them."
3544,0.26124594155844155,"I found Wildcat Movers from the Google Reviews, and I'm very glad that I went with them. They were punctual, professional, and logistically very SMART movers. They would do little things like: create handles with tape on the mattress corners so they weren't pulling the fabric at the seams, load as much as possible into the elevator, then move the elevator, then unload to next destination. I am not a moving pro, but I can tell it's the little things that make a big difference. The 2 movers on my move were relatively new to Wildcat (Jeremyah - about 3 months and Jabin - about 1 month), but they were both very professional, courteous, hard-working, and good at their jobs. On top of that, they had VERY GOOD attitudes, which goes a long way in my book. I would be thrilled if I had the opportunity to move with these two again."

Katie is amazing and she did a lot of handholding with us from the very beginning. We didn't know where to start and Everydoor provided us with an actual book of knowledge so we knew what to expect and  what to budget for. I love the care our realtor Katie took with us. She listened to what we wanted, always made herself available to see houses, she was consultative but also never pushy. She reiterated time and time again that she wanted us to be comfortable and that put us at ease as we made offers. Not only was Katie amazing while working with us but she also did so much research on the houses we were interested in and ultimately that made a difference when our offer was accepted. She was always in touch with the sellers and gave us whatever insight she could snoop out.
My fianc√© and I are not from Seattle and it was a wonderful experience to work with a realtor like Katie, she made us feel like she was in our court and that was a relief, especially after meeting with a few other realtors previously that we just didn't gel with. I would highly recommend!"

11206,0.2609360410831,"I recently bought my first home with Danny. When I think about the time we spent working together, what really stood out to me is all the ways he helps you feel confident about the decision you‚Äôre making. From the first interaction, Danny makes sure you have foundational knowledge of the home buying process by distilling the process into a series of easy to understand steps. As the search progresses and you start looking at properties, Danny does an excellent job of highlighting the pros/cons of houses and what will limit the resale value down the road (as a very pragmatic finance person I loved the objective way of looking at these properties). As you start to think about offers, Danny does an excellent job of simplifying the intimidating legal documents and potential contingencies you can choose to include/forgo when you place an offer. Finally, once you are under contract, Danny will do an excellent job of explaining the different steps and parties involved in the process. As a first time home buyer, working with Danny was great because I felt like I had a seasoned coach walking me through the entire process.

The other thing I want to highlight about Danny is that he genuinely cares and will not pressure you to make any offer you‚Äôre not ready to. For example, at one point I was on a call with him discussing whether to put an offer on a house. I eventually got to the point where I said, lets go for it, but Danny could hear the uncertainty in my voice and suggested that I take a few minutes to think it over and call him back. I thought about it and still made the offer, but I greatly appreciated that he wanted to make sure I made the right decision for me and didn‚Äôt just jump into something too quickly.

I would 10/10 work with Danny again and would absolutely recommend him for anyone looking for buyer representation."
4016,0.2609090909090909,Had a very positive experience. Bolsun and Oscar were great. They packed everything very carefully. They were both respectful and mindful of my roommates.

I have had a half dozen major moves so far in my life.  No move is ever perfect.  I''ve experienced everything from hiccups in scheduling, to movers trying to cheat and overcharge me.  I've had things broken.

None of these things happened to me when I used Wrightway.  I had to be moved from a house into a temporary apartment, and 7 months later, move again into my new house.  My experience was so good with Wrightway the first time, that I chose them again after that 7 month gap.

The crew was courteous, clean, and moved as fast as they could.  My time went over what was estimated, but I didn't mind because I saw those guys bustling.  I would definitely recommend Wrightway."

10839,0.2605489605880231,"Dallas Luxury Realty is a phenomenal realty company. I used them for my recent home purchase and could not be more satifised. I originally went with a BIG name realty company that did nothing to help me find a home. They would go out with me every couple of days to look at properties and I always had to refer all my questions to the realtor's assistant.  I was getting no where fast!! Then a collegue refered me to Katya and my whole experience changed for the positive. Katya took me out daily to view properties and was so helpful and informative on all the ins and outs of home purchasing.  She made me feel super special.  She truly values all her clients.  When she couldnt go out with me, she would get other realtors to go to the properties with me and always kept up with my thoughts and ideas.  When Katya had to go on vacation, she assigned me to Sandee and she did a FANTASTIC job while Katya was gone. Sandee ultimately helped me with the home that I currently own today.(Closed on May 30th, 2012)  I am thoroughly happy with the service I received from Dallas Luxury Realty and HIGHLY recommend them for anyone looking to make a home purchase in the near future!!!  ***also, their website is OUTSTANDING!!! If you sign up it sends you a list of all the new properties available for rental and purchase on a daily basis AND the website updates several times a day with all the lastest MLS listings******"

The market in our area  is changing constantly and with Team Diva you get not one agent you can count on in the toughest of negotiations, but you get an entire team.  No joke.

When selling on 2 occasions with Team Diva they sent over an entire team to get me ready to list and be the best most aggressive new listings  on the market.  I'm still stunned on one home they listed and staged for us we got 23 offers all above asking.

The other 2 occasions I was on the buyer and Team Diva pulled out all the stops and all their knowledge to make sure I won both times.  One time under asking and another right at asking.  That's a big deal in this hot market.

Even my 23 yr old daughter was happy to call Team Diva when she was ready to buy her first home.  Team Diva made sure she was looked after through the entire deal process right till closing.

I thought the presentation was fresh and smart, and earmarked them for whenever the day came to put my condo on the market. Well, that day came this past Spring, and I‚Äôm so glad they were the team I contacted. I can honestly say I didn‚Äôt have one stressful moment selling my condo. From my initial meeting with Matt, to meeting with Ian and Brian to go over the things I could do with my condo to freshen it up before putting it on the market, to Amber letting me know when the condo was hitting the market, and communicating every step of the way until it sold. Communication from the first meeting all the way to the end was extraordinary. Email, text, or telephone ‚Äì all forms of communication were responded to quickly. I felt like I had an entire team of people in my corner! Their attention to detail went unmatched, and the behind-the-scenes people of Brian‚Äôs crew who spruced up the place as well as the company who staged my condo before listing all did amazing work. I‚Äôm confident had it not been for this team effort, my place would not have sold as quickly as it did.

We drove the truck from The Colony, TX to Tampa, FL and everything arrived undamaged.  Wildcat Movers are tremendous and highly recommended!  Thank you!

10917,0.2594444444444445,"We're so glad that we had Geoff during our first time home buying process!
He has an incredible amount of experience in this industry that made the process easy for us. We literally don't know how we would've done without him!

Geoff knew so much about the Seattle neighborhood. We were looking at houses from Beacon Hill to the edge of Shoreline. While we were looking at different properties, Geoff was able to give us helpful insight into the property history and future impacts to property value. He was able to provide so much color commentary to each property. Not only that, but Geoff has a network of reliable contractors and house inspectors that he can vouch for based on his previous experiences working with them and homeowners. All these things helped us make informed decisions and mitigate any risks.

He is SUPER quick to reply to our e-mails, calls, and texts. And always took the time to answer our questions, which is very important as we were first time buyers with lots of questions. When we wanted to put an offer on the house (that we bought!), he stayed up late to talk through the process with us and explore our different lender options. He even did a 3 way call with us and the MLO to ensure that everything is set in stone for when we would put in the offer that night.

Once we put the offer in on the house, Geoff handled the relationship with the selling agent very well. We were able to get an inspection contingency and he kept the sellers/selling agent well up to date with the closing of our loan. We almost got delayed with our closing because of our bank institution, but Geoff was very ON IT! He would contact us and told us what we should expect for next steps every step of the way, which helped keep us informed.  If there were any risks with delaying our process, Geoff was very quick to point it out and helped us communicate the urgency with our MLO.

Geoff is truly a well rounded agent (plus more!), and he passionately advocates for his clients which really makes him stand out. We highly recommend Geoff for any buyers out there."
10901,0.259375,This was our second time working with Rob and his team. Both experiences have been fantastic. He and his team provide valuable insight in the markets and negotiations and walk you through every step of the transaction. Rob will go out of his way to make sure his customers feel calm and relaxed and get the best deal possible. You won't even think he has other clients because he treats you as if you're the only one.

Next time I need to move something I will call Wildcat first."

These guys are very well trained and personable and will handle your items with care. The guys that did my move did such a awesome job. They were friendly and had great attitudes which is usually not the case with moving companies. It was a stormy rainy day and they didn‚Äôt complain or have a bad thing to say at all, they just worked hard and efficiently. They wrapped everything really well. Not a scratch or damage to a single item. The owner Jeff and his wife Angie are really wonderful and a joy to deal with. If I need to move again I will definitely be using them. Would give 10 stars if I could."
11345,0.2585164835164835,"Selling my condo was a kind of journey, or perhaps one could see it as a video game. In either case, Working with Geoff was an exceptional experience. He is extremely knowledgeable and easy to communicate with‚Äîalways up front providing all the options along the way. He was willing to go the full nine yards throughout the process. As an example, while I was in Europe he would stop by my place every couple of weeks to water the plants. You might notice that we share the same last name‚Äîjust a coincidence, no nepotism involved : ) No reason to trouble yourself looking for the right realtor‚ÄîSimply put, he's the best."

I had my home listed with another realtor for 3 months without any offers. After listing with Geoff I had 4 competitive offers above my asking price within 2 weeks.

I would highly recommend listing your home with Geoff"

He‚Äôs always there to answer any questions you have and is always ready to look at available units with you ASAP.

Christian was prepared with our route and had fantastic, competing units.
He was patient, great listener, and knowledgeable about the market. He guided us throughout the whole process and we got a great deal.
I have sent Christian multiple referrals because I know, without a doubt, they are in good hands with him."
11303,0.25833333333333336,"We worked with Geoff last year to purchase our first home in an incredibly challenging Seattle market. As a first time homebuyer we interviewed a few realtors and decided to work with Geoff based on how much time he spent answering our questions and laying out a very logical approach to home buying. Geoff never pushed us to make risky offers or offer anything more than we were comfortable with. He has a lot of prior experience to draw on, and helped us to navigate the process. We also talked with Geoff‚Äôs recommended lenders, and ended up having a fantastic experience with Steven Fujita. If you‚Äôre a first time homebuyer, or just a homebuyer with lots of questions (like us) - Geoff is an excellent resource and realtor."

We also parked and toured three units in thirty five minutes in the neighborhood I wanted, driving me to avoid having to move two cars with meter prices in Miami Beach.

He still answers my texts with questions and refers me to the utilities and house manager list of contact information as to who to contact.

He‚Äôs a good contact to have for a realtor and I‚Äôll use him again when my apartment lease is up if I still am living in South Florida."

On the first day of snow in Seattle, the city fell apart. Buses were sideways on every hill and cars were getting stuck left and right. Kyle talked to us on the phone and asked if we still wanted to move that day. We told him we were flying out the next day, so he made it happen. He worked out a perfect spot to park the truck and the safest and most efficient route to our U-haul pod from our apartment, and he decided to bring another guy along to make the move more efficient because of the snow. The team moved our furniture and boxes quickly and carefully out of the apartment, wrapping our couches and bed tightly in saran wrap to keep them safe in the pods. When we got to the pods, the team helped clear off the snow in the path to keep everything dry. They helped keep our furniture safe for shipping by wrapping everything carefully in furniture pads. They pieced everything incredibly efficiently into the pods, using the space as well as physically possible. Thank you Easy Company! We really appreciate your help."
10070,0.25815789473684214,"Extremely satisfied! Worth over 5 stars, there is nothing that they could have done better within the listing process. I'd say that even if this service would've cost couple hundreds of dollar like a typical flat fee listing service.
This one is better in all asspects, and yes, it's really free, from listing to closing!
The process is very clear, you filling the house information and load the pictures, shortly after you'll get the MLS draft for approval, and with no time its MLS listed. The actual  listing appears as good as any other, you'll never guess its not a full 6% service one. Agents will call you directly and its up to you to take it from there. My process, from listing to closing took less then 5 weeks, and again, zero fees to Richr!
You don't need to over think it - its just the best ""by-owner-like"" service in town, with the appearance of ""full service"" one, while being free...:)"

11397,0.257,"I cannot say enough good things about working with Kim, Chavi and Roy. We have bought and sold multiple times as well as rented with Roy's help- over a 15 year period!

Our most recent sale was during an international work assignment so the entire team managed literally every detail for us while we were thousands of miles away. Our home required some extensive repairs prior to sale and I cannot imagine trusting anyone else with the job. We had 100% confidence the entire time and knew we were getting the best work, documentation and sale price possible. Their process is transparent, focused and individualized. And I can't forget fun! This office and team are fantastic in many ways- always keeping a good sense of humor and perspective.

Additionally they give back to the community and are very involved in what is happening in their neighborhood, city, state and in the country. They go a step further and not only encourage others to be involved, but give them events and resources to do it. They are true leaders in the community and take time every year to send appreciation to their clients- whether you have used their services many times or only once it does not matter- everyone is included in the gratitude. We will never use anyone else for our real estate needs- this is the best team you can get."

They all took great care of our belongings. There were a few items we weren‚Äôt sure would fit into certain rooms/doorways but they were able to figure it out and make it work. They were all so nice that it felt like moving with friends (except better.) Overall, I cannot say enough about these guys. We will be sure to request the same team in the future."
11488,0.2566666666666667,"Like most people who don't want to pay a hefty commission to sell a property, I decided to go the FSBO (For-Sale-by-Owner) route. I found Richr while searching for FREE MLS listing sites. Richr advertised a FREE MLS listing and NO listing agent commission when the property is sold. For anyone hesitant about Richr's listing service being totally free, I say to you, don't be; it really is FREE.
How do I know this? I recently went through the entire selling process from listing to closing with Richr and saved over $8,100 in real estate commission fees.. Richr was professional, proficient, and pleasant to work with. I also used Richr's title company for what turned out to be one of the smoothest closings I've had in the 40+ years I've been in the real estate business.
I highly recommend Richr to anyone trying to save money when listing a property.

This is to update my original review from 1/23.
I used this AB moving again this year and I still stand by my first review. The Reyes team did an excellent job and they did it with a smile. It was very cold yesterday and they never complained. They were very kind, professional, personable and they really made my moving day enjoyable. None of my things were damaged. They used furniture pads and shrink wrap on all of my delicate items. I am very satisfied with the service I received. 10 out of 10!"

11569,0.25645896656534944,"We worked with Marc, Jason, and Claire for purchasing our first home. As first-time home buyers, there can be a lot of steps and sub-processes, that can become extremely overwhelming, and expensive. If you're the kind of tech-friendly person that is able to do their own research online, and do it well (using listings from various online resources such as Zillow, Redfin, Trulia, etc.), then WaLaw's business model should DEFINITELY be your first choice. You pay a simple flat fee, which allows you to save a sum equal to ""the difference between the buying agent's commission (3%), and the flat fee you pay WaLaw."" This is particularly helpful to offset some of the extra costs/charges you incur for closing on a home. At no point in dealing with Marc did we ever feel like he did not have our best interests at hand. He is extremely detail-oriented and will be able to push back on the seller for a variety of issues (that a regular realtor may not be able to). Additionally, because of the flat-fee model, Marc will do his best to negotiate as much as possible (realtors' interests in doing so are not aligned with your interests of saving money - read 'Freakonomics' to understand this further) :)

The fact that Marc is also a real-estate attorney (and former loan officer), made it even more worthwhile - it was an awesome value-add to have his eyes on loan/purchase agreement documentation we were signing, terms we were agreeing to, etc. Always good to understand your liabilities in such large investments, so this was totally worth the fee you pay WaLaw!

The only minor challenge you may encounter is scheduling time with WaLaw to look at homes from M-F during business hours - but if you are flexible with your schedule during this process, and are able to shortlist with relatively good accuracy the homes you wish to take a look at with WaLaw, you will find that Marc and his team are very flexible and helpful. The icing on the cake was how responsive everyone at WaLaw was to our questions/concerns/issues - they are easy to email, text, and call as necessary, and will help clarify all the various stages in the process.

This is certainly the future model of home-buying and selling, so I encourage you to at least call them and explore your options with them - my wife and I could not be happier with our experience. Best of luck to everyone reading this, and I hope you find your dream home/sell your home with success (like we did). Cheers!"
10497,0.25642857142857145,"We had a great experience selling our house in Lynnwood, WA with Alexis Martz of Trelora Realty.  We were highly impressed during our first meeting when Alexis came to look at our house, fully prepared with comparable sales data in the area and suggestions for getting the house ready for listing.  She recommended a very competitive price, higher than we had expected, and we received almost full price offer within a week of listing.  Alexis knows the real estate market very well and is a highly professional individual.  She was always available by phone, text or email, anytime we needed her.  She was a great negotiator with the buyers agent, and she saved us a lot of money after the inspection and some other demands by the buyer.  Alexis always had our interest as her highest priority in getting us the most amount on the sale of our house. Alexis kept us fully informed during the entire process all the way through the closing.  We highly recommend Alexis as a realtor whether you are selling or buying.  We will definitely use her services again in our future real estate needs."

He conducts weekly check-in‚Äôs, is highly responsive, practices COVID19 etiquette, has a large network of credible contacts you can leverage given his experience, has an assistant who like him is organized and accommodating, and has an extremely informative and well-done YouTube channel with highly relevant content that is updated frequently. During house tours, we were impressed with his acumen on all things related to a home. We never felt pressure to put an offer on a house as he always let us lead. When we decided to submit an offer, he gathered intel for us quickly, provided his strategic input, was thorough, and made us feel comfortable with each step. The Seattle market is tough and his guidance was invaluable. For the home we ended up purchasing, he made sure we even felt supported during our fast closing, checking in to make sure things were going smoothly with our lender. He even threw a special celebration when we got our keys, which we appreciated, by delivering lunch and giving us thoughtful housewarming gifts including a surprise for our kids.

After seeing our reviews on both Yelp and Google, I was contacted by Zane the owner. After a conversation, during which we explained everything on our end. He was cordial and accommodating and refunded us for one hour of service. My advice is to do a lot of research when moving and call around to 3-4 places for quotes to make sure you are getting the best deal.

Boosting up from 1 star to 3 stars because he was so eager to make the situation better.

PS Just make sure you pack all sentimental items yourself and transport them yourself so you can make sure they get there safe and secure.

___________________________________________________________________

As I sit here and read more of the ""good"" reviews the madder I get. Mostly because the two gentlemen that moved us said REPEATEDLY, ""Leave us a really good review and you will get $10 back.""

You quoted us $300-350 for a ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT 600 sq ft. So that is what I budgeted for. I thought at the MAX it would be around $450. SOMEONE tell me how in the world did it cost $800 to move a 600sq ft apartment? The two guys that came, moved extremely slow, stopped so many times, and used the restroom three-four times. (To clarify, I'm not mad about them using the restroom. But if you're going to charge by the hour, move faster). After I asked how we were doing on time because I knew this would be over budget, the guy responded, ""Would have been quicker but the stairs make us go slower""...... WHEN i DID THE QUOTE I TOLD THEM I WAS ON THE SECOND FLOOR OF BOTH PLACES.

Also many of my things were broken, a vase, a expensive pan and a novelty cookie jar. We're still missing a box of kitchen items.

From other bad reviews, I can see that this company does not value customer happiness at all. And to all inquirers beware, they DO basically beg you to leave a good review. So I wouldn't trust any of the good reviews. When I moved last time I used All My Sons, they moved quickly and efficiently and it was less that $400. Use them. Do NOT use this moving company."
1366,0.2552998737373738,"When we decided to begin our search to purchase a home after more than a decade of renting, we were referred to Every Door Real Estate by a co-worker, and we feel so fortunate for that referral. It led us to working with Erik Vordahl who has helped us through the very intense process of looking at houses during COVID-19 with a 2 year-old in tow.  Erik was always patient and mindful of the circumstances as we took turns viewing each property (one of us always had to stay outside with our toddler). Throughout our search he was knowledgable and honest about the process of making an offer on a house in the Seattle area, which is extremely competitive and fast-paced. He was always receptive to the many questions we had as first-time homebuyers. When we finally were able to make an offer on a home that we really, truly were excited to purchase, Erik was instrumental in getting our offer accepted. We couldn‚Äôt ask for a more thoughtful and people-oriented person to work with on the biggest purchase of our lives. He and the team at Every Door Real Estate worked very hard to make sure we were all set up to make the best possible offer when the time came, so when it did, everything went off without a hitch. We will be moving into our new home this autumn. We would highly recommend working with Erik and Every Door Real Estate if you are looking for a local, knowledgeable , and truly caring agent to help you on your next home purchase."

He worked with us for a few months before we actually started looking, fielding our many emails and sending us house searches to help us get familiar with the market. Once we started looking, Danny made us feel like we were his only clients - always available over email/phone, super on top of arranging showings, and really great at pointing out positives and negatives with each house. He is incredibly knowledgeable not just about the ins-and-outs of Seattle real estate, but also home ownership - in particular, Danny is really skilled at identifying possible issues (especially in older homes) and also noting good choices made by sellers.

Danny is also a pro at crafting an offer, an essential skill in such a competitive market. Importantly, he helped keep our spirits up when it seemed like we might not find a place, and in the end we bought a house that was even better than we had expected. Buying a house during COVID-19 certainly brings its challenges and tons of unpredictability, but Danny was patient, professional, and supportive throughout.

This was our second home purchase (first in Washington) and Danny is the third realtor we have worked with - compared to both our previous experiences and our expectations for this one, he really hit it out of the park."

And every single time we wanted to put an offer Dexter made sure to come back to us with all the tools and analysis we needed to make our offers stand out. We settled for the house of our dreams and it wasn‚Äôt even a house we had planned to see.
But he knew what we were looking for and put our needs first. I really do appreciate the work and effort he has put in helping us get our dream home. I honestly recommend him to everyone I know that‚Äôs looking for a realtor that‚Äôs going to listen to you, guide you and help you get what you want.

Thanks Dexter !

2018 Review
Dexter knows the real estate industry from top to bottom. I told him exactly what we wanted and he delivered. Sold our home in 30 days and moved into our new one in 15 days. That level of commitment and determination I could not have found anywhere else. Highly recommend‚Ä¶."

Alana is very trust worthy and went above and beyond to be flexible, educate us, and guide us throughout the entire process. She worked diligently around the clock every step of the way, even putting together a last minute offer for our dream home while she was on vacation in Mexico over the Christmas holiday (which ended up being accepted by the sellers by the way!). We were blown away by her dedication, integrity, and efficiency throughout the entire process. We would 10/10 recommend her services to anyone looking to buy a home in the Dallas area."
11183,0.2536212121212122,"I guess I'll write yet one more 5 star review for Geoff Hill! Highly recommended for any first time home buyer. Geoff gave my wife and I the space and had the patience we needed to figure out what we wanted and what was in the realm of possibilities and at the very moment we had our epiphany and said ""That's the one!"" he put in a bid and we went on a camping trip and he made it all happen! With a few periodic check-ins to receive the counter offer and counter it we came in under asking price and came back from our camping trip with a new home! He took care of all the nuts and bolts stuff leading up to settlement that most new home buyers are clueless about as well as educating us along the way about the whole process. There's plenty of phony stuffed shirts out there in the Real Estate business but Geoff has a class, style and character that is all his own that put him way above the rest and in a league of his own. We give him the highest recommendation to all those purchasing in the Seattle area. Thanks again Geoff!"
7086,0.2535899814471243,"As a first-time homebuyer, I couldn't have gotten luckier than being referred to Get Happy at Home.  I had a very tight deadline as I needed to find a place, buy it, and move in ‚Äì all in under 8 weeks. I was nervous about making the wrong purchase in such a short timeframe, but with the confidence and expertise of Matt and Ian, I was able to relax knowing that they‚Äôre taking care of everything.

When I was worried about potential competing offers on the home I wanted, Matt immediately reassured me with a confident ‚ÄúWe will win‚Äù ‚Äì it just sounded like a fact. We even beat my tight deadline üòä ‚Äì after we first met, we sent out an offer in less than a week and I was able to move to the new place in less than a month!

I cannot stress enough how much I had a sense of ‚Äúbeing taken care of‚Äù by Get Happy at Home. Both Matt and Ian were completely on top of my purchase, so it didn‚Äôt matter if one of them had a conflict with another client. Whenever I needed anything one of them was available to give a prompt reply or fit me into their schedule.

They steered me away from what would have been some potentially bad choices and were able to provide a litany of information about every aspect of buying a home. All their contacts were great to work with, and Matt and Ian provided a ton of advice on how to navigate the whole process. This was crucial to someone like me who knew absolutely nothing going into this.

It was also just a great time working with Matt and Ian. They were so warm and friendly that I really enjoyed working with them, and I‚Äôm excited about the next time that I get to reach out. I‚Äôve already been recommending them to as many of my friends that will listen!"

After viewing over 30 properties he painstakingly reviewed my criteria and patiently showed me different areas and homes. My goal was to find something that was unique, had an impeccable view and was large enough to accommodate my growing family, including my white German Shepard, Apollo.  Sage is concerned with his clients desires and it shows.

Also sage was instrumental is helping me link up with financial institutions. With his Harvard degree and also his MBA he truly shows that he has amazing training and deep passion to give his clients the best.

9019,0.25266666666666665,"No one can truly perceive the challenges associated with selling a residence. Undoubtedly, it has been the most arduous experience I have encountered thus far. Exhausting all alternative avenues, I endeavored to discover a means to sell my house. While recognizing that the primary objective of this industry revolves around maximizing the company's profit, regrettably, it appeared that the focus lay more on monetary gain rather than ensuring the contentment of both myself and my family. Nevertheless, a benevolent acquaintance directed me towards Peak Cash Offers, and I must express my sincere gratitude for their concern towards my welfare. The team consistently ensured that I comprehended each and every document I was presented with. Among the esteemed members of the organization, Mel, in particular, was quite noteworthy. His assistance and careful explanation of every document instilled confidence within me, thereby facilitating a prosperous transaction. My elation knows no bounds. Within a few short days, the transaction was completed, and my house was successfully sold. Furthermore, their exceptional service extended beyond my expectations, as they expertly managed the logistics, even arranging for a reputable moving company. Their genuine concern and seamless facilitation of the entire process unequivocally demonstrated their commitment to my satisfaction. Consequently, if you are contemplating selling your house, I strongly urge you to consider this superior establishment. They took great care of me, and I am confident they will do the same for you."

Our experience with Weisbarth and Associates raised the bar for the real estate industry!

From the in-depth introduction call, many in-home tours to many late-night offer calls‚Äîthey were with us every step of the way. In an unprecedented 2020 real estate market where houses are going upwards of 15% over listing price, it was comforting to know that the Weisbarth team discussed the climate during weekly team meetings and with Doron at the helm we felt so comfortable in their hands. Doron has over 20 years of experience and we trust his judgement.

Our real estate broker, Blake Ciscernos, was a delight to work with. He is a strong broker with many years of experience, yet he is the most patient and calm guy you will meet. He is super knowledgeable about the Seattle market and was always listening to our needs and must-haves in our future home. It was great lean on him for his ideas and his perspective that always stayed true to our wish-list.

During the summer 2020 home-hunting season, its been a challenge to navigate the ever-changing stay at home orders. But we all approached it with calm and grace. Blake was always early to meet us at our tours. He was always wearing a mask to protect himself and others, and behind the mask we could tell he was also always wearing a smile.

When it came time to do our final walk-through, he was so patient as we toured the home with a contractor to shore up the small items on our list of to-dos. The home was in beautiful condition-albeit a few items that we wanted to address. Like missing trim in the closets, broken window latches and a closet door with jams rubbing one another.

We had wondered if the sellers were able to address the small issues prior to closing and we reached out to Blake to confirm. After consulting with Doron, unfortunately, we weren‚Äôt in a position to ask because we had waived several contingencies in our offer. The team really wanted us to have an awesome experience and focus on our our beautiful home. We were delighted to hear that Blake and team would go the extra mile and cover the repairs for us. What a lovely gesture!

If you are looking for a no pressure, pleasant and trustworthy experience in buying your next home, don‚Äôt hesitate to simply attend the introductory call with Blake. The rest of the process will be just as easy and natural. His expertise is unparalleled in the Seattle real estate market!"

Danny was very professional and met me nearby my office to give me an overview of the home buying process which was helpful and informative. Kudos to Danny, I didn't prioritize my home search for quite a while after that meeting, but he would regularly check in without pressuring me to start looking at places. Thanks for hanging in there with me! When I was finally ready, he made himself available for home tours on my days off, and was a trouper since I wanted to see as many places as possible each day. I'm thrilled I was able to find my first home and have Danny help with the whole process."

They moved all of our large furniture with such care, there was not even a small scratch on any furniture or on the walls of our home. They were literally more careful than us trying to move things lol.

I know he had our best interests at all times, and he never made us feel like we were forced into certain decisions. He completely and thoroughly explained each step of the process, so that we always felt confident with our decisions. I was warned that preparing my house to sell would be one of the most stressful times of my life--with Geoff, that thought never crossed my mind. Seriously, look no further. Give Geoff a call!"
6754,0.25042424242424244,"Michael was exactly the kind of agent I was looking for, he was an investor-friendly agent. He helped my wife and I purchase our first home and investment property in Burien, WA and use it as a househack. His knowledge of the local market and the multiple REI strategies gave us the confidence to pull the trigger. We got the house in a hot market (summer of '22) when there were multiple offers, but his knowledge, negotiation and ability to write up a great offer stood out to the sellers and we got the house (while not being the highest bidder!). He was more than an agent to us ‚Äì he educated us along the way, and helped us analyze the deal, and as a new and aspiring investor myself, I REALLY appreciated this!

If you're looking to buy a home in the Seattle area, I would highly recommend Michael and his team. My wife and I are very much look forward to working with Michael again on our next property."
11566,0.25034562211981565,"My wife and I were referred to Geoff from our daughter and her fianc√©e who he helped buy their first home. We were living in Los Angeles at that time. It was reassuring when we learned of the advice Geoff was giving them that led to their eventual home purchase. Their experience with Geoff was great and we all love the home they purchased with his help.

We moved to Seattle from Los Angeles last summer and decided to rent before buying as we knew little about any of the neighborhoods. Recently retired, we also were not clear on our goals or what we were looking for. We looked at everything from land for us to build a home on to a house with an ADU and most everything in between. We were all over the map in every respect including our budget.

Geoff always immediately helped us seriously consider our many different scenarios when we wanted his help. He also knew (without being told) how to give us the time we needed to simply explore on our own between considering specific options. We never felt pressure nor did we ever feel as though we were being handled. At all times it was clear to us that Geoff was focused exclusively on meeting our goals and making sure we understood the downsides of properties we considered buying. He would ask us questions like were we sure we wanted to maintain a large deck, did we want to have an arborist on speed dial, did we notice this or that thing we might regret having not noticed? In short, we led, and he supported us while displaying a broad range of the kind of expertise and competency that can only come from lots of relevant meaningful prior experiences.

Because of his actions, the kinds of advice he gave that emphasized integrity, the range and quality of information he provided for us quickly, and his ability to listen to and meet our needs; we are confident in recommending Geoff without reservation. From us, that is our highest recommendation and is intended to communicate something far exceeding a great review. We ended up with the right property negotiated at the right price for our needs at this time. If our needs change, we would enthusiastically seek out his help again."

They were on time, very polite, very efficient hard workers. They were very careful moving my dads piano. They prepared all of his possessions for the move beautifully. They secured everything in the truck and were ready to go in no time!

We also used their recommendations for our loan officer, who was also super responsive and great to work with.

We followed her expert recommendations and if we didn‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt think that we would have sold our house nearly as quick or as close to asking. Some homes that went on at the same time, are still sitting! Within hours of contacting her initially about wanting to sell our home, she jumped on it! Christy immediately came over to look at the home and since we had a 7 month old she created a plan that worked around our needs!! She was always there to answer any questions or even come by last minute if we needed her to. From coordinating staging, photos, and inspection, she made this process super smooth.

When unpacking a person always wonders if you are going to find something broken but that is not the case with this company. The crews I've had are very pleasant and fast.  They get in to get the truck loaded so that they can get you to your new place and get you unloaded. They don't play around just to charge you extra money.  Your fees are discussed up front there is no hidden up-charge.   My crews helped me get my washer and dryer connected, placed my furniture where I was wanting it - I mean these guys are great!

If you want a dependable, trustworthy moving company you need to talk to Wrightway Moving Company.  Why settle for less when you can have the BEST!!"

I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better pair or the fact that they were teamed up. When we had questions both of them were there with answers and never got tired of our (mostly my) tiny silly questions. The process was laid out for us step-by-step and despite it being such a crazy stressful process, we felt like we were in great/confident/supportive hands the whole way. I couldn‚Äôt have imagined a better experience as a first time home buyer. Open, honest, and hilarious experiences and conversations with each home we looked at and a beautiful (and cheeky) gift when we closed and moved in! Did I mention that because of their team structure they were able to be super flexible with our schedules and commute!

If you are in the market to buy or sell a home, call Team Diva. Of course I‚Äôd recommend Roy and Juniper, but had nothing but great experiences with everyone else we interacted with in their office."

They were very responsive by email and answered all the questions I had.

My movers were Dan, Alejandro and Hawk they were awesome! They worked very fast, and communicated with me consistently. They were all done within 3.5 hours. It helped that they had a large truck so they only needed to do one load/unload. The other thing that helped was that they were unloading to a storage unit only 8 minutes away . They were great!  I even laughed and had fun getting my things out of the apartment and into a storage unit which is a lot to say since I hate moving haha. They took care of my things, and were very respectful yet friendly at the same time towards me.

They handled our delicate furniture with great care, wrapping it meticulously to ensure its safety. This attention to detail alleviated any concerns I had about potential damage and allowed me to trust them completely with our belongings.

What impressed me the most was their efficiency. Richard and Tyrell worked diligently and completed the move in a surprisingly short timeframe, while maintaining the quality of their work. They were focused and committed to providing a quick yet thorough service.

It is worth noting that AB Moving operates on an hourly rate, and I commend Richard and Tyrell for consistently giving their best effort throughout the move. They avoided unnecessary breaks and slacking off, ultimately saving us time and money.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the service Richard and Tyrell provided.

Roy definitely made things feel manageable and talked me off the proverbial ledge more than once during the process! I was impressed by the prompt attention I got any time I had questions, and how the team went above and beyond to coordinate details when I had to leave town right before my condo was supposed to go on the market.

After calling multiple moving companies to get a quote and not having a single one answer my phone call, I discovered Wildcat. They answered me on my first phone call and had an estimate to me within 15 min of reaching out. Our movers were Enrique and Janard and they were both great!! They were incredibly friendly, professional, efficient, and all of our stuff arrived at our new house without any damage. They were thorough in asking us where we wanted everything placed in the new house VS just setting it where ever was easiest for them which my wife and I appreciated. Don‚Äôt waste your time calling multiple companies who won‚Äôt bother to answer or get you a bid in a timely manner - just go with Wildcat and make your life easier! Thank you Enrique and Janard! We would happily hire Wildcat and you guys again."
10424,0.24816524621212122,Dior was amazing! My boyfriend and I were looking for a place to live with only a few days to search. We had a very broad idea of what we were looking for and were brand new to the area. Dior set up and took us to view around 20 places in just a few days. We saw so many amazing properties and Dior was such an asset in helping us decide which places were in our best interest. She advocated for us when negotiating with property managers and made sure we got what wanted. Dior is exceptionally knowledgeable and made the often very difficult and arduous task of finding a home a wonderful experience!

Michael‚Äôs experience as a real estate agent and experience with his own investment properties was immensely helpful. He already had a network of contractors, property managers etc. which he had built over the years and graciously shared with us. When we were touring a house, he was always able to answer all our questions ranging from neighborhood, repairs needed, how to increase value of the property, how to add another unit, quality of existing additions etc. I highly recommend Michael and the househack team for any real estate investor looking to buy in the Seattle-Tacoma-Everett area."

On her wise suggestion I had my home inspected, as there actually were a number of maintenance items that came up in that inspection and she even arranged to have all of the repairs completed in a very short time. The only thing I had to do was to let the repair folks in. Then, to my surprise, Johnine , had all the windows and the whole house cleaned before listing it. She then had the house beautifully staged and had the yard cleaned up with even a little landscaping thrown in. The house sold within the week for OVER full price!
Everyone I dealt with was always kind, helpful and professional, their communication was exemplary all through the process. I‚Äôve decided to rent for a while but you can be assured that it will be Johnine and her team that I will go back to when ready to purchase a new house. I have sung her praises to all that I know."

From the start he was professional and detailed - and I genuinely felt like he was working in my best interest when it came to assessing different properties.  He's very knowledgeable of the market and has a well defined sense of identifying value and staying away from potential problem properties.  The process of touring was always efficient and worthwhile, and when I did eventually find my home Danny took extra time to walk me through all the paperwork and procedures.  All in all, working with Danny made my real estate buying experience much more smooth and transparent than it could have been, especially in the red hot Seattle market.

11078,0.24660714285714286,"I am writing this review from the comforts of MY house. It still feels so good to say that. This house would not be mine without the hard work and responsiveness of Geoff Hill.
Jon and I were referred to Geoff by our friend Kate who had recently bought a condo. She and her fianc√© raved about him and he definitely lived up to the hype. First sign that he was the right real estate agent for us, we met him at a bar in Ballard, he was chill and we talked about what we wanted in a home over beers! During that conversation he set up a custom NWMLS search for us and we started the home search!
From that point on If a house came on the market that we wanted to see, Geoff would quickly contact the listing agent and we would see it. The market in our price range was very competitive so it was important that our agent was proactive, and Geoff was.   We went on a few house tours on the weekends where we would see about 4-5 houses. It was really fun going to see houses with him and we learned a lot and gained confidence.
He was so responsive to all of our questions as well. Given that we were first time home buyers we needed a lot more hand holding. Geoff seemed happy to teach us all about the process which made it a little less intimidating. He referred us to a great mortgage broker who was also a pleasure to work with.
He never pressured us to like a house. In fact he was brutally honest and did not hold back about a house's flaws or the little tricks selling agents use to sell a house. I really appreciated his transparency.
We signed documents using DocuSign apps on our phones and computers! I was happy to be working with an agent who took advantage of modern technology.
He even attended our inspection for us while we were out of town and took pictures for us and promptly contacted us to fill us in on the results. It was not an ideal situation that we were out of town at the same time as our inspection, and I appreciate that Geoff was so supportive.
Our experience searching for our first house was both exciting and scary and Geoff helped us every step of the way."

11555,0.2461324041811847,"To be honest, my first experience with Every Door was not a good one, and I wrote a negative review. Much to my surprise, I received a personal phone call from Jason G., one of the co-founders, who wanted to hear directly from me, my experience. I remember being taken off guard, but impressed, that someone who co-owns the company would take time or even care about making a personal phone call to a former client, one who had bought a condo for less than 300k. He listened carefully to my experience without saying a word, and then made a gracious offer of how he planned to make the situation right.

He put me in touch with Aaron Peterson, who I refer to as a Top Gun/Navy Seal in real estate. He goes in gets the job done quickly and flawlessly. Aaron's reputation speaks for itself--check out his profile/site. He was professional, highly skilled, answers calls/texts quickly, and makes you feel like you're his top priority. Most importantly, he got the job done better than I could have ever imagined, and quickly. When a low-ball offer came in with lots of concessions from the buyer, I thought this will not end well. Within a short time, Aaron came back with full asking price and 100% clean offer. The fact that Every Door cared enough that I was satisfied with their services, even though my transaction was small. impressed me beyond words. In an age where customer service is not a high priority, and it's difficult to even get in touch with someone who can help you, let alone someone who cares about making things right is rare. Using the latest technology and a team approach whose skilled experts handle every detail, such as marketing, contracts, listing, and financing, leaves the agent/broker free to focus 100% on your transaction. To say they exceeded my expectations is an understatement. My experience with Every Door is they do care about the customer and not just closing the deal. I have not hesitated to recommend Every Door to others since."

2105,0.24576754385964908,"Before I met Kevin, I was previously working with a realtor who was a total nightmare and made the process extremely difficult and unpleasant for me. Originally, I thought that was going to be my reality and this was when Kevin from Every Door Real Estate came into the picture and he completely changed my experience and perspective on working with realtors. Kevin was so friendly from the get-go. He made sure to ask questions that I didn‚Äôt think of and in return, educated me on the whole process of real estate so that I was prepared to face what was coming. In addition to this, Kevin responds fast and he follows up with you to make sure we are both on the same page - and communication is extremely important for any buyers with the process being very time sensitive. However, the most enjoyable aspect working with Kevin to me was how he was able to make me feel like I do not have to be rich to be successful in this process. Although money does play a major part in winning an offer, Kevin was so patient and understanding towards my budget because even though we had some losses, he was able to find creative ways to help me win my dream home! The winning of my first home was truly all thanks to how patient and understanding Kevin was throughout the process, and that‚Äôs really something every buyer could ever ask for. I remember when some of our first offers were not accepted, Kevin called to encourage me to keep going and that was all it took for me to not give up and here we are closing my first home! I highly recommend everyone to work with Kevin and I promise you will not regret it (like my previous realtor, big yikes). Thanks for everything, Kevin!!"

Once we started working with her we found our first home in just a few weeks. It honestly felt like a miracle. We were so grateful to have someone actually listen to our needs, and find us a home we would love. She was extremely available and attentive during the home buying process as well, and quickly responded to every text and call. We are so grateful we had the chance to work with Angela and we would recommend her to anyone in a heartbeat. She really went to bat for us during the whole process and it was amazing to have her know-how on our side. We have been in our home for a year now and could not be happier.

10460,0.24535308441558443,"I hesitated , as I wasn't familiar with the name Richr. But then after speaking to Serena,I knew I had made a wise choice . Tradition is to use a listing agent ( that costs 3% commission) to sell your house. Then you must pay an additional 3% to the realtor who brings you the buyer. On top of that there are title and doc fees. I knew in such a hot market with limited inventory that it was foolish to pay someone to sell so I chose to use Richr . They listed the home on the MLS, also included the title and handled all the documents flawlessly. I never left my house , all done by electronic signing and the cash now sits in my account. I couldn't be  happier with their excellent professional service....and at 1%, plus the 2% I offered to buyers realtor, I saved 3%!!! In cash terms that was $7,600. and that was a small house in Central Florida. Imagine the savings on a Miami residence . Thank you Richr !"

10168,0.24528822055137844,"Expertise and Authenticity!
I very much appreciated Danny's service, guidance, and expertise through the purchase and sales agreement and his continued support and expertise through the mortgage process. The entire home buying experience, from starting the house hunt, making the offer, to closing, I believe took fewer than 90 days.

I particularly appreciated Danny providing properties for my consideration via my Keller-Williams portal that he set up, his fair and impartial comments on the properties we visited (such as the cackling rooster and barking dog that greeted us‚Ä¶even though that house was so cute) and features of ""flipped"" properties to consider (not all bad...just things to consider). I also very much appreciated the ""what now"" timeline Danny provided after our offer was accepted, his attending the house and sewer inspections AND him attending my signing appointment with the notary.

Danny's quick responses to my many questions and weekly progress updates throughout the mortgage approval process further illustrated his personal client commitment and professionalism. Danny is knowledgeable in each step in the home buying process and is ever present for his client. Danny even left me a special message when my property closed welcoming me as King County's newest homeowner - very thoughtful wording and a nice touch to cap off his exemplary service! I gladly recommend Danny's services."

6512,0.2444242424242424,"Abigail Echols is the best agent I have ever dealt with. I don't even know where to begin to describe my experience with her. First she is such a sweet person, she was very honest with us as we were undecided on whether to sell or continue renting. I was desperately looking for an agent in the Puyallup area and she made herself available on a Sunday. We are a military family that didn't live in the area and she took away all the stress of trying to sell a home.

Abigail did all of the leg work, from hiring contractors, coordinating with our renters and management company. Our home was unrecognizably beautiful when she was done. It was on the market for only 4 days before it was pending sell. She was always available for questions and so patient with us while we made our decision to sell. I really feel that this review does not give Abigail the proper credit she deserves as a person or agent. If I could give her 10 stars I would. If you are looking for someone that will go above and beyond for your family, call Abigail Echols."

My furniture arrived in absolutely perfect condition and everything arrived here, not one thing missing, nothing went wrong (at all!) which is rare!
they were responsive, detail oriented, respectful. They went above and beyond to do their job to our satisfaction. I feel very confident recommending them for your move.

Starting with Mike in the office who was super and communicating with me and flexible when my date changed a couple different times.
Their pricing can't be beat.  But dont let that fool you.  I thought for such a good deal, the workers might be sub-par.   On the contrary!!!  My crew, Axel, Saul and Eric were phenomenal!!! Extremely polite, very careful with my items, listened to my needs and special requests and super hard workers!!!!  I fully expected this to take much longer, but these guys were awesome.  I was blown away with how knowledgeable they were with how to negotiate my things down three flights of stairs, as well as packing my truck.
I still have a couple days drive and to unpack,  but feel confident my belongings will be safe and undamaged.
I wish they could go with me to TN to help me move into my new place!

She went above and beyond the call of duty helping us navigate the entire home buying process from our initial dabbling our toes in the concept all the way to negotiating an amazing deal. She managed to write up an offer that beat an offer that had four times the amount of earnest money then us, AND an appraisal buffer, and negotiated with our lender to get us a $500k loan with only 3% down instead of 5. Not to mention all of the little things she did (some not so little) Driving us all over the area all the way from Everett to Kent, and ALWAYS having a sympathetic ear to any questions or concerns we might have, and throwing us a WELCOME HOME party on our closing date. I can't imagine trying to navigate this process with anyone one else. Michelle is an ANGEL! And the entire team at Every Door Real Estate made this stressful process easy to understand and navigate.

If Peter did not know the answer himself he made sure to use his resources to find out and bring one back with confidence and accuracy. He works day and night with you to ensure the proper house is found and that you will be satisfied with your selection. The entire team at The Every Door Team was a blessing to work with and I would not have wanted to work with a better team for my first time home buying experience. Everything was streamlined and a lot of stress was lifted off my shoulders making this whole process a smooth one.

First of all their rates are reasonably priced and the movers were highly professional and handled our stuff with care. They completed the move faster than we expected and were really courteous of our needs. They didn't drop or break a single item and we were very impressed with the service. The only issue we faced was regarding the payment as initially we were charged for the extra hour that they used but  we received an invoice the next day for the additional cost of the hour and we paid off the amount. I wish it could have been clearly dealt on the day of the service. Overall, this company is the best fit if you're looking to move under a budget."

7359,0.2436363636363636,Incredibly phenomenal customer service. I paid extra for a fourth person I moved from a second story apartment to an eighth floor condominium and they did it in such a fast manner everything was in perfect shape as it was delivered and the people were so gentle very heavy packages and boxes I couldn't be more happy with the positive outcome of this move. This was the second time I have used this moving company and couldn't imagine making the move anywhere else within South Florida without the expertise and professionalism this company showed.
7043,0.24349284349284353,"After receiving multiple quotes from the largest, most reputable moving companies in Dallas, we decided to hire Wildcat for both the packing and moving of our home. Their prices were in line with the others, but we really liked their demeanor, the ease of getting additional questions answered and the fact that they offer double what is required by the state of TX for insurance coverage. We have a lot of one-of-a-kind vintage furniture items that are incredibly special to us.  It was hard for my wife and I to entrust someone else to move them.

They showed up on packing day with all of the materials necessary to neatly and safely pack our smaller belongings.  They worked diligently through the day packing everything we'd asked them to.  They asked questions when necessary and made sure to label each of the boxes down to the room and contents (so helpful for unpacking).  The guys were all really nice and we had no issue leaving them in the house to work and do their thing.  They took direction well and just got after it.  It was nice to not have to micromanage the whole process as we had plenty to do ourselves.

On moving day, Jaylon, Brooks, Dalton & Deshun showed up on time with smiles on their faces and began laying out protective covering for the flooring.  They wrapped all of our furniture in blankets and then plastic wrap prior to moving.  Any special requests we had, they paid close attention and executed flawlessly. We had two bends in our staircase that I routinely banged things into over the years.  Somehow they managed to not ding one thing (not one!) into the walls of our staircase - I really didn't think that was going to be possible.  All of the beds, cribs, etc that had to be dismantled were done with care and reassembled in place once into the new home. Unlike some of the other companies we got quotes from, they didn't show up with one truck and try to pack it to the brim.  They brought two trucks and thoughtfully loaded them so that everything was safely packed and not liable to break.  These are the extra mile kinds of things that really set them above the competition for us.  Anyway, the move out went great and then they showed up to our new place and doubled down on just doing a great job of bringing things where we wanted them and not banging up our furniture/walls.  I was a nervous wreck most of the day, but in the end, it wasn't necessary.  They killed it.  Absolutely phenomenal job from start to finish.  Customer for life."
2866,0.2433730158730159,"I used Wildcat movers in my first move and I enjoyed it so much that I went for a second round with them. The movers that I had this time exceeded the expectations of the first group, and the first group was really amazing as well. Erick, Marshall, and Timothy were extremely professional, very careful with all belongings, and held excellent conversations with us. The fact that they disassemble and reassemble appliances and beds is a really good service for someone like me who has large furniture. They also have a packing service where they will pack the boxes for you. I didn't take this service because I didn't need it but it is there if someone needs it. I definitely will be using the same three gentlemen again when the next move comes. Hopefully that won't be for a while because as we all know moving is very stressful, but they took the stress right out of this move for me!

I hope to see these three gentlemen again someday!"

11332,0.24295454545454545,"Rob (and team) exceeded expectations on every level. Which is surprising, because this is our 2nd transaction with him and we already had high expectations. Rob recommended and managed the work that would make our home more valuable to sell. Through these projects, we sold the house for ~25% more than we were thinking we'd sell the house before the projects. Rob (and team) handled everything. The team maintains runs a well-orchestrated weekly process that keeps us up-to-date without overwhelming us with unnecessary details. They know what is actually important, and what ultimately isn't. The process was stress-free and surprisingly little work on my part. I have, and will continue to, recommend Rob to everyone I talk to. As an added benefit, I recommend most people to read his weekly newsletter too."
1985,0.24294871794871797,"Hi Wildcat! It‚Äôs a wonder that an agreed upon agreement only benefits you as the business but not me as a consumer of your services! I was told during my move inventory that I would be able to transport a motorcycle. The transportation of the motorcycle was the main reason why I decided to go with you all as well as the seemingly great reviews you all had. Boy was I fooled! First off your movers arrived late. I didn‚Äôt make a fuss about it because things happen. They didn‚Äôt call to inform us they made it to my place until I, in fact called you all to inform you that I didn‚Äôt receive a call. Whatever- no big deal! Things happen! But then after I agreed alongside the inventory rep, Nathan that my motorcycle would be transported but it was not due to the negligence on Wildcat movers, this is where I became truly upset. Not once was I informed that the motorcycle could not be transported until the day of the move. Not once was I informed that the motorcycle needed to be free of gas for the move until the day of the move. All of this could have been communicated to me. To add frustration to annoyance,
I was not even allowed to get my estimate changed since the motorcycle was no longer on the inventory. It is on the inventory list- but was not allowed to be moved all of a sudden though  I paid for it. Also one of the movers even told me that the inventory reps just say whatever to get people to use their moving services. They will literally say they can move something during the estimate process that actually can‚Äôt be moved just to get money from people. Absolutely unacceptable.  What a shame- being charged for something that I literally paid for but didn‚Äôt receive. It‚Äôs all good. If you use wildcat movers just make sure that they abide by their own agreements to you as the consumer! They will def make sure they are covered. So just take care of yourself as a consumer. Personally, I would never use them again, nor would I recommend them to anyone. I will definitely be reporting them to the BBB for deceptive practices.

Three stars for the actual move and movers. They were great! Also the owner made the situation better by offering us a small percentage off our move due to our troubles. We appreciated that. However communication needs major improvement as well as customer service. Thanks"

While I was in another state, Henrique negotiated my contract, arranged for a walkthrough, was easily available by phone, answered dozens of questions, and made the process so easy I never had to even come to Miami to find my place.

I was nervous at first to agree to move without physically seeing the property, but it‚Äôs beautiful. I had difficult constraints (had to be furnished, more than 1 bed, in-unit laundry, available for 6 months, and in an upscale building) and he absolutely nailed it.

Not only did he ensure that all my utilities were hooked up and ready to go before I moved down, he also helped me out when I had to delay my move in date. He held onto my keys for me and met me on a weekend when I could finally move in.

That night I had a small issue with the apartment and Henrique physically came in person to help sort it out for me.

You cannot go wrong with Henrique, at Miami Realty Solution Group, I absolutely recommend him to anyone looking for a place in Miami."

Major pros:
1. They managed to fit everything we needed to take into one Upack container, which saved us the $2000 for another cube.
2. They kept the whole process right at 2 hours, which was super efficient (especially considering it's 100 degrees outside).

We had plenty of questions and decisions to make and having Geoff in our corner made all the difference. After multiple offers and inspections that fell through, Geoff dug in  and worked with us even harder. His energy, passion, and expertise helped us end-to-end, through the ups and downs of closing, and even after closing Geoff has been available to help with home questions and repair concerns. Geoff has customers for life."
10778,0.2416666666666667,"The folks at Richr.com have a great business concept to help home sellers and buyers save huge. As a seller, and having owned our house only 2 years, we were very reluctant to list our house for sale in the traditional 6% commission split in 3% for seller / broker fees and 3% for buyer agent.  We needed to keep as much equity as possible for our next home.

After days of searching for an affordable solution, ( there are plenty fix costs services out there but not all that useful at the end of the day), we found richr.com where they will list your posting on the MLS for free in exchange for using their closing / title services which we need no matter what.

We offered a 2% buyer commission and the house sold in 3 weeks. We saved $25K in commissions by doing some of the work ourselves. The rich.com team was always amazing and helpful walking us through the process. We will definitely use them again and we have already recommended them to others."

They worked fast and efficiently instead of dragging like some movers can do. They‚Äôre a teeny bit more expensive but worth it when you consider they‚Äôre moving all of your valuables. I will definitely use them the next time I move."

During showings, he allowed me to take my time to check out the properties and made me feel very comfortable with the entire process. I always felt that he was in my corner and had my interests at heart. He made buying a home way easier than I could have hoped for. He is highly knowledgeable without being a pushover. I've had experience with other realtors, but they have yet to compare. Abe is definitely my forever realtor!"

The payment is hourly, and they work as quickly as, in my previous experience, movers did not work even with a fixed payment for moving. Honestly, at first I was stressed about how everything would go. And in the end, such a great moving experience - polite, neat and calm. Thank you!

The truck broke down on the way to move us because of a flat tire.  We had to wait for another moving crew to finish another job before they came to start moving us.  We had to move out of our house within 24 hours; so, time was not on our side.  It was very stressful trying to do all this in 24 hours.  I cannot blame the moving crew; but, I think the company should take responsibility for the truck breaking down and not having a backup plan.  The truck that moved us was not in the best shape either."

His extensive knowledge of market trends and what to expect at each stage of the process, helped put us at ease. We were also relocating from another state at the time, and appreciated how Geoff and his team were not only always quick to respond, but also available to view properties whenever we were in town.

Sage‚Äôs professional skills and hard working ethic made our first time buying a house a pleasant journey!
It happened in a tough market and there were enough factors to make it stressful.
We purchased a new built and dealing with builders sometimes adds more unexpected turns.
But with such experienced realtor as Sage
it was simplified and it worked out in our favor.
Will definitely know who to contact in case we would sell or invest in real estate.
Thank you!"

These days when you hear all sorts of stories of people having delays with receiving their belongings from other movers that store your stuff with other people‚Äôs, at Phoenix, they move you directly from your old place to your new place, even if it‚Äôs states away. Simple as that! I was really impressed by what other people wrote in their online reviews of Phoenix and knowing that they are in good standing with the BBB and possess the insurance and licensing to move across state lines and just one chat with Jeff sealed the deal for me. He will take care of your move like you were a family member! Their pricing is competitive, they are super speedy, and take such care to wrap and protect your belongings in both loading and unloading. I‚Äôve never had a move go more smoothly!

She is so knowledgeable and if we had questions she couldn't answer she went out of her way to find out for us. For what could have easily been a more stressful experience, we feel things went so smoothly because of Rene's hard work, experience, and care. 10/10 we will recommend Rene and the Housed team to anyone we know with real estate needs.

We highly recommend Dexter.

He always heard our perspectives before sharing his own view point, offering suggestions and clarifications whenever possible. This made us feel understood and kept us on the same page.
As it was our first time buying a home, Michael did a great job at educating us through every step of the process such as bidding, finding lenders, home inspections, etc. He was able to find information about other offers to ensure our offer was competitive. Thanks to his negotiation skills, we were able to get an offer accepted at $5K below listing price which is unheard of in hot Seattle market! He also stayed on top of everything during the home buying process, following up with seller‚Äôs agent, title company, and various other parties involved in the transaction.

Michael is very resourceful as well and has a great team comprising of lenders, home inspectors, contractors, etc. We appreciate his proactive communication and he always made himself available for a quick Zoom call or to visit a hot home on short notice. As a real estate investor himself, he has a keen eye for details and potential investment angle on properties. For eg, we were able to find a home with 6 bedrooms, with a potential to carve out a 2 bedroom ADU from it. Michael is knowledgeable about such matters and can offer guidance about such opportunities for house hack as well.

5610,0.2394630336983278,"I would recommend Phoenix very highly.

No hassle, on-schedule, reasonable prices and fantastic friendly team. Couldn't have gone better!

I hired Phoenix Express to move with the following details:
- move was within a 30 minute driving distance
- move everything from my 3-bed 2-story town-home to a 2-story 5-bed 2-story single family home (with the exception of fridge, washer-dryer)
- packing and moving both included
- rooms had moderate furniture including beds which had to be disassembled before taking out; several items that needed to be unscrewed from the walls (shelves, office white boards etc.), curtains also needed to be taken down leaving the curtain rods
- garage had a gym with a large rogue rack and 300+ pounds of weight and heavy horse-stall mats each weighing 90 pounds
- my wife was 7+month into pregnancy and I wanted her to stay stress free

I have only great things to say about phoenix including:

1) Beau Danielson was great - he visited my home and surveyed within 15 minutes, described how the process would work and gave me a reasonable quote within a few hours - I did not negotiate the price since it seemed reasonable including the goods insurance
2) Chose a date online for the move; packaging was scheduled for Thursday while move was scheduled for Saturday
3) On Thursday Beau called to let me know that an earlier slot had opened up on Friday (if I chose or I could keep Saturday) which worked great and I took it
4) I had to do no follow up - packers called me the day before and so did the movers - they were right on schedule
5) The movers team from Phoenix is great - they followed my instruction to the dot - they even assembled a few furniture items in the new home that lay disassembles and unused in my old home; started 8:30AM at my old home and only took 20 minute break for lunch and finished well before 5PM
6) No nicks/ scratches anywhere on my stuff or my old/ new home; reassembly was perfect including my garage gym

My wife stayed very happy throughout - mission accomplished! Thanks Beau and team!"

They were fast, efficient and took care when moving everything into our condo. The team was respectful and great to work with. When we move again (hopefully not for a long time) we‚Äôll give pure moving a call.

Their pricing is also extremely transparent - they are a preferred moving company of our new building and all around great to work with.

In the summer of 2020 I looked to upsize from my contemporary townhome in Lower Greenville. I connected with Rawlins and Dallas Contemporary Homes, and I must admit, I was a bit skeptical at first, because there was a lot at stake being both a seller and a buyer. My time was limited, and with so many agents in Dallas, it's tough to be certain that you're choosing the correct one for such an important task!
Rawlins listened closely to my needs and desires, and he created a unique and comprehensive gameplan that honestly seemed a bit too good to be true. I'm quite the skeptic, so initially I pushed back a bit to test him. However, being the true professional he is, Rawlins was incredibly patient with me, never pushy, and genuinely concerned about my well being throughout the process. He really took the time to make sure
I understood WHY certain things were done the way they were.
I could tell that the entire DCH team was not only interested in getting both transactions completed smoothly for me, but it also was TRULY interested in ensuring that I made as much profit as possible on my sale while saving as much as possible on my purchase. In the end, that's EXACTLY what occurred! I'm now living in am amazing modern townhome in the heart of Uptown Dallas, and my Lower Greenville townhome was sold over the holidays with multiple offers!!! HOME RUN, GRAND SLAM, BOOM!!!
The way Rawlins lays things out for his clients to understand is unmatched, and he's never phased by any questions you may ask him. His confidence and calmness in all situations was so reassuring to me, and it really helped me to feel at ease with the entire process. Not only did I get everything I dreamed of, but I also made a new lifelong friend!
Thanks Rawlins and the entire Dallas Contemporary Homes team! Y'all are the best!

735,0.23933566433566433,"I've never used a moving service before, so I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. I called Wildcat Movers because of their great reviews online, and they simply asked what I was going to move. We scheduled for a move the very next day. They arrived (right when they said that they would) with 3 friendly and efficient guys - Anthony, Arturo, and Westley. All three of them worked together to swiftly yet carefully wrap, secure, and move all of my heavy belongings into my new home. They were able to do all of this within the two hour time-frame within which I had hoped to accomplish my move.
I don't anticipate moving again soon, but when I do, I will certainly be calling Wildcat Movers and requesting Anthony, Arturo, and Westley. Thanks guys."

3342,0.23923611111111115,"My experience with Abigail Echols at Every Door Real Estate has been a breeze. I'm a first-time home buyer in a tough market in Mountlake Terrace/Lynnwood area. Abigail came recommended to me by one of my neighbors as I sought to buy into the townhouse complex where I was already living as a renter. I could not be happier with my decision!

Not only does Abigail know the Seattle area market well, she is kind, responsive, an attentive listener and comes armed with ideas and strategies to help you achieve your goals. She helped me secure a pre-market deal to buy into my complex under my anticipated budget. We were under contract just 11 days after my first conversation with Abigail. All of our transactions have been digital with e-signatures, which is a service I specifically look for and appreciate. She also recommended a local mortgage broker and inspection service, both of whom have also greatly surpassed my expectations. I am forever grateful to Abigail for helping me make this process so easy!

Additionally, I appreciate Abigail's passion for helping people to buy homes. She gave me nuanced advice to help me make an informed choice, and did not pressure or coerce me into any strategy I did not agree with. She has a refreshing point of view about some of the pervasive biases and challenges in the real estate market, and will advocate for you to make the best choice for you and your family. I recommend her without reservation!"
4175,0.23923340548340558,"Short version, I was really impressed with Easy Company.  They did a great job packing and moving from our 3-bedroom home, the final bill was slightly less than the estimate, and I would absolutely use them again.  Highly, highly recommended.

Long version: We put a bid out via Yelp, and most folks replied with their hourly rate.  Kyle at Easy Company asked me to share a high-level list of the furniture and things we needed packed.  He got a preliminary estimate to us right away, and a more detailed estimate based on photos I took of everything going to the new house.  It took a bit more time, but it was a much more thoughtful approach and we ended up with a more realistic estimate.  Throughout all of our interactions, Kyle was highly professional and demonstrated a lot of integrity.

That professional, high-integrity approach continued on our packing and move days.  One of Kyle's team members called in sick on our packing day, so Kyle came out himself to help out.  He also brought in another team member toward the end of the day to help.  It wasn't much of a change, but Kyle was up front about things and took responsibility.  More importantly, the team packed our *entire 3 bedroom home* in about 7 hours.  They asked helpful questions about how I wanted things handled, made thoughtful choices about what to pack together, and just did a great job (thanks, Dante and Alejandro).

We had a similar experience the next day for our move.  4 men and two trucks got everything over in about 4 hours, and they were super thoughtful about putting furniture and boxes together in rooms that made sense.  For example, everything from my wife‚Äôs office at our old house was in the right room at the new house, and same for every room and closet.  That made a big difference when it came time to find our things.  I was really impressed with every member of Kyle's team (thanks Dan, Dante, Kyle and Luis).

The packing came in slightly above the estimate but the move came in below, so overall we came in slightly below estimate.  Nothing was damaged, and there have been a lot of times over the past few days where we're looking for something and it's easier to find because of the decisions that the packers and movers made.

What a great company to work with.  Highly, highly recommended."

Darcie was very responsive (email/text), punctual and her flexibility amazes me. Often times she will showed up early and check the house before I went in. Darcie and her team truly wants her client to get the best of everything. I closed my house within 30days and Darcie was very supportive to get me through the complicated house buying procedures. As a first time home owner, Darcie  and her team really understand and very patience to walk through everything with me. Thank you Darcie and team!"

I expressed what I was looking for and my price range. Wilson found 3 houses that fit exactly what I wanted. He gave me the list so the day before we met, I drove by the houses to look at the location and general feel of the neighborhoods. I found one I knew I really wanted so we met at that house the next day. The house was perfect and we started the paperwork.  What I really appreciated is that Wilson is very thorough. All paperwork was ready for me to sign. Everything went super efficient and hassle free. Wilson was with me every step of the way explaining everything in detail. I will for sure recommend Wilson to all of my acquaintances."

We got through to Colin and it was probably the best Realtor experience we've ever had.  Within an hour we met with him and had a few places lined up to go check out.  He was able to tell us about the areas we'd been looking previously and give good feedback on them.  We ended up going with the last place he showed us and we're extremely excited.

Dallas Luxury Realty, and Colin in particular, will get all my future business and I cannot recommend them enough.  My only regret is not finding these guys sooner."

10020,0.2386111111111111,"To say Danny is incredibly talented at his job is an understatement. He will exceed your expectations in all your real estate endeavors, regardless of whether you are a first time homebuyer or a practiced investor. He has holistic knowledge of the industry, is hyper-supportive from end to end, is reliable, punctual, and, most important- he is honest! He has some serious negotiation skills and will do whatever he can to make your offer stand above all others. I had complete trust and faith in him throughout the entire closing process, which is important since I had little knowledge in one of my biggest investments I‚Äôll ever make. My lender and escrow team wouldn‚Äôt stop talking about how great he was to work with. Overall, Danny is beyond a 5 star agent, and my entire team who helped with the buying process would attest to that."

They brought the supplies we expected, were very considerate of our belongings and spaces, and worked hard throughout the entire move.

I had originally scheduled packers for one day and movers the next, but they called beforehand and offered to do both in one day. It saved me a ton of time. Everyone was on time and efficient. They packed and unpacked quickly and everything was in one piece. The packers labeled absolutely everything, so things were very easy to find and sort. The movers also moved my car on a trailer so it didn't have any mileage on it or the tires. They took great care of all of my things. I had items going to a couple of different locations, and they were able to do so without any trouble. I am very grateful as it was a big move but Pheonix made it far less stressful than it could have been. They were extremely flexible and accommodating.

The rather ambitious timeline we had requested for the sale of our home was daunting at first, but Josh was so clear in his communication of the step-by-step plan that would make it all happen.  What's more is that he was there every step of the way and even took it upon himself to physically lend a hand with the preparations to make the home ready to be put on the market. Talk about going above & beyond!  Josh promptly answered any questions we had, and made the entire experience so positive & seamless.  We could not have been happier when our home sold quickly and for full asking price.  Anyone would be lucky to have him on their team - for his strong communication skills, attention to detail, and the transparency & integrity he brings to his work.

More than once, what he found seriously affected our bidding strategies, and saved us from what could have been a costly purchase.

On top of all that, he's personable and all-around great to work with. I've heard people say that when it comes to real estate, don't choose someone who will tell you what to do while trying to ""razzle dazzle"" you with what they know.

By pure accident we ran into Trelora agents at a farmers market.  These guys were very friendly and agreed to come out to the house the very next day.  Their selling proposal is almost too good to be true.  We had some time so we took a chance on this company that we‚Äôd never heard of.  We could not be any happier!  These folks have selling down to a science. Everything is in-house including the photographer so everything ran so smoothly. As soon as we said we were ready for photos they had us on the MLS within 24 hours.
The communication is all done by phone email and text. They were so responsive. We never waited more than a few minutes for a response.
They also use an app for agents to schedule showings so we could manage our own showings.
It is very a streamlined process and really the wave of the future. Not to mention the flat fee makes it so attractive!
I think they will put traditional real estate agents out of business.  And for context we are seniors and not at all put out by using our cell phones and computers to make this all happen. I felt we got better personal attention than most other agents we‚Äôve used"

The next time we move we will definitely go with Easy Company again :) thank you for everything !"

10928,0.23631854256854257,"Buying and selling real estate is nuts!
Working with Trelora keeps the nuts from getting caught in your zipper!

Going through hell was a much easier process having an experienced guide by your side to show you around. Trelora helped us sell our house, navigate new well and septic laws and stay on track to close! Others involved in the transaction were absolutely ridiculous! The buyers and their agent seemed to be proficient only in the art of pissing contests. Our agents at Trelora were professional and stayed clear of their streams.

On the buying side, we got an AMAZING deal because of Trelora's ability to negotiate price and use their added value to bring a savings to us and them! The bumps in the road were never caused by Trelora, in fact, most were overcome solely because of their navigation. We completed negotiations, paid for and completed inspection, paid for and completed appraisal and the sellers attempted to walk away- threatening to lawyer up if necessary. Trelora helped us through that and we ended up closing on time!

We had bought a home before and our previous agent was only concerned with her commission and pushed us to buy every home we saw, and to not negotiate anything. Not only did Trelora make themselves available, they never seemed concerned with their bottom dollar, only our best interest. We saved over $5k selling our home and saved $20k buying our new one! We will never buy or sell a home again without them! Real estate is a bend over and take it business! Working with Trelora, I not only got to keep my money, but I got to keep my pants on! Forever appreciative!

The movers showed up about 5 minutes before the scheduled start time, and from start to finish, the move was completed in 2 hours, including travel time! (I moved locally). The movers were friendly, made conversation, and packed my belongings carefully. The only drawback is I wish they had a more secure way to accept card payments. I would definitely recommend this company to anyone who needs to move, and will use their service in the future if necessary."

6422,0.23550917336631624,"The global pandemic and ensuing global work from home environment really changed the way we viewed our home, how we live, and what kind of space we'd like to grow into. Rob worked with us to identify our non-neogiatiables in these areas to very quickly narrow down the location, and type of home that would ultimately work for our family. He called weekly for status check ins, and walked us through the buying process as a whole during Covid, so we knew what to exactly what to expect. We closed on time, and received keys just at the cleaners were finishing up on our sparkly new home.

We're working with Rob again on listing the home we're moving from because we enjoyed him as a person, and trust his subject matter expertise as a realtor.

Update 12.21.2020 - After a great experience working with Rob while buying our Bothell home, we decided to work with him to list our Lynnwood house. Initially we wanted to take our time renovating, and listing at a later date, but Rob suggested we do an initial walk through Lynnwood to evaluate the 'must  do' renovations that would get us the most return versus the misc. items that didn't really matter at end. We listened wholeheartedly and rallied to get the house painted, windows washed, and some power washing to make the house sparkling. Rob suggested we hold off on renovating the cabinets and tiles, and let the new home owners deicide how they wanted to do it themselves.
This kind of sound practical advice saved us thousands of dollars, and months of renovation time. We were able to list our house pretty quickly - and after explaining to us his strategy to capture the most amount of interest at a certain price bracket - ultimately netted us a significant all cash above list price offer with a 2 week quick close.
We would absolutely recommend Rob and his team to anyone looking to buy or sell. You would not find a better of folks looking out for your best interests. Thank you Rob, Lessa, and Kristina!!"

Each set of houses he curated for me helped refine his understanding of my taste.   By the end, every house was a house I liked in a neighborhood that met my needs.   Through multiple offers and setbacks, like COVID-19, Sage always came through with enthusiasm, confidence and professionalism.   He knows the Seattle area very well and was able to combine that knowledge with what I was looking for to narrow and refine our search after each house we viewed.

At first I was a little skeptical of what level of service I would actually receive for a flat fee amount of $495 at listing and $495 at closing. Well we were beyond impressed with the quality and level of service we received. Tod did everything that any other agent would have if we would have hired them. He did his research to help us understand what homes were going for so we could make an educated decision with our listing strategy. He took amazing photos of our home and got the home listed quickly and on all of the major sites buyers look. He guided and educated us as the offers started rolling in and was there for us every step of the way. His experience and expertise was so helpful as we sorted through all of the offers and began the negotiation process. He did a great job and we are so appreciative of all of his efforts in getting our home sold for the best possible price!  Even after we closed Tod was still willing to deliver great service to us.

Ashley was also quick to recommend an inspector she works with as well as specialists for additional inspections when needed.

7784,0.23349544072948325,"My husband and I hired Phil as our real estate agent for our home and have gotten to know him professionally and personally through the process. From the first call that Phil made to me, I had the best first impression of him that was confirmed through his work with us. He has consistently taken the initiative in every aspect required of his profession, and beyond.

He is an expert negotiator, knowledgeable agent, communicative, and he has upheld the highest standard of reliability. Phil has communicated first hand with inspectors, offering parties, and loan officers involved in the listing of our home. His motivation to sell is true of heart and is not from greed. He has conducted more than his fair share of open houses and communicated with hundreds of people who had expressed interest in our home. His professional opinion has been highly valued by us, especially since it was our first time listing a property of ours. He did not pressure us to doing anything his way, and allowed us to make decisions for ourselves in what we felt most comfortable with.

In personally getting to know Phil, we have learned how generous and genuine he is in character. Phil does leaps and bounds for his clients in more ways than any other agent would such as coordinating extraneous affairs and researching important topics that are not his responsibility. Furthermore, Phil has been real in being himself and present with us. This quality is one of the most desirable and admirable since you must spend a lot of time with your agent in the process of selling your home.

His business, Assist2Sell Realty of Seattle is not only a confident move, but a smart one if you are looking to buy or list. In selling your home, there is only a flat rate commission instead of a percentage based on your home‚Äôs value (and I personally believe that Phil works equally as hard for every home he gets). My husband and I were first worried about the work ethic that would be reflected by this commission rate; from working with Phil, our concerns were easily abated and we are gladly returning to him for the next sale of our property.

If you would like to ask us any questions about the service we received from Phil, we welcome you to contact us for an openly honest, and obviously raving review. We hope to see Phil‚Äôs business continue to be successful since we expect such growth to be solely attributed to his hard work and personal efforts."

3084,0.2333621933621934,"I was very (very) fortunate to stumble upon a listing from Brian Chesman of HOUSED many months ago, while still living in the (state that shall not be named). Unlike almost all of the real estate agents that I had contacted (across the country), he was professional, patient, dedicated, friendly and on the ball from DAY ONE.

To be honest, I wasn't even sure that I wanted to move to the city where Brian was showing homes. I was checking every state in the union.

His efforts and knowledge of the city AND more importantly‚Äîknowledge of the buildings and areas (down to construction materials + problems and/or noise issues) were my deciding factors (plus he knew where all the grocery stores were lol). Brian even went so far as to call his client on the phone while I was in his car to ask them about how much noise issues they experienced in their condo, which I was considering buying. So I got the truth, without sugar coating. And trust is the number one issue when dealing with an agent.

Brian toured me around town and dealt my questions, queries, concerns, annoyances, etc., all with extreme professionalism even braving the disaster zone of the infamous winter storm that we just had, to show me a condo that I was interested in.

His tips on the ins and outs of the process, and the repeated documentation provided by Brian and his team were top notch. They made the process smooth and easy to handle all the way to the purchase date.

And I'm sorry if this sounds like an ad but it isn't. I don't get compensated for writing a review nor is my purchase pending. I've been living here for about 2.5 months and love it. Anyone interested in moving out of their disaster zone into a happier, safer, dynamic city(s) could not go wrong by reaching out to Brian and the HOUSED team.

My sincere thanks to him and everyone involved in getting me into my new home."
9294,0.2333333333333334,This is a fantastic company with great movers.  I have used them twice and my daughter used them to move from Carrollton to Houston.  They pulled furniture out of storage and my rental and moved me to a four story townhome with no complaints.  They moved 1/3 of my stuff to declutter into storage now that I'm selling and will move me to The Woodlands.  You can't go wrong with Wrightway.

4526,0.23333333333333336,"Janine Rasey is an amazing real estate agent. Our journey was long and ends with our dream home.

We first started looking for a home back in 2021. Because of the pandemic, the housing market was very competitive. Janine guided and supported us throughout the process. She never pressured us to go outside our comfort zone. Unfortunately, the market was more stressful than we anticipated and we made the decision to end our search. Janine was so kind and understanding and cared more about us taking care of ourselves versus pushing to continue the house search.

Janine checked in on us for the next 2 years. Finally in Spring 2023, we were ready to get back into house searching. We trusted Janine and knew we wanted to work with her again and she welcomed us with open arms. She brought the same enthusiasm and energy as we toured potential homes. We quickly found a home that we fell in love with. Janine built a great rapport with the selling agent which proved to be instrumental as many competitive offers were presented to the sellers. Due to Janine‚Äôs strong communication and negotiation skills on top of working late on a Friday night, she helped give our offer the edge it needed to get our offer accepted! We know that the offer was accepted because of Janine and we couldn‚Äôt be more grateful for her.

We are so happy we ran across her profile 2 years ago and could not imagine working with someone else. I strongly recommend Janine to anyone who wants a real estate agent that genuinely cares about you and will work her hardest to help you find your home."

In fact, we closed on our very first home less than 30 days from enlisting their services. In a market where Seattle homebuyers are in extreme bidding wars, we were able to come out on top and WIN our first offer and negotiation. Kim and Chavi got us out viewing homes within the first few days and within 48 hours we were in contract (snapping up a home before its open house, the day after in came on the market). The mortgage lender was able to close three times as fast as most banks. From start to finish, it was the easiest move in my entire life. My living situation has improved so dramatically, and so easily... I cannot fully express my gratitude with just these few words. :)"

3947,0.23310485810485812,"Investorade....whoa...they know what they are doing!! truly a 1 stop shop if you are in the market to sell your home and you don't know what or where to start!! Yes they are 1) investor 2) flipper 3) cash offer but also a number 4) realtor!.  From the moment I sent the email to inquire about a cash offer I was fearful of getting raked over... was I in for a big surprise!! No sooner than I hit send on my inquiry I got an immediately email from Shaniqua that she would be reaching out to me. We scheduled a time and she came out to visit but let me say what a doll she is!! I knew immediately over the phone she would set me at ease and she did not disappoint! She spent a solid hour with me and assured me that my house WAS NOT A FLIPPER!! She also knew I needed to sell fast so she could have just said lets flip but she knew the house was not a flipper and said she wanted me to meet Alex their amazing realtor. Assured me he would walk me through the whole process and even hold my hand if needed ...lol she knew I was a nervous wreck! Absolutely a sweet, warming soul who knows how to make you feel at ease.Well let me tell you Alex is wonderful...he DID HOLD MY HAND all the way through selling my house within few days and closing within 26!! He literally stayed in contact 24/7 and checked in on me knowing I was emotionally sad and struggling to sell my first home that I had 24 wonderful years in raising my daughter and loving the city of Sachse. He had so many offers within few days from the RIGHT prospects that he stopped taking new bids. He had so many amazing families interested in it that I wished I could have given them all a little piece of it...but lol we know that wouldn't work. I truly never had any questions because he was so thorough and stayed with me every step of way. He has stayed in contact after the selling of my home as well. He makes you feel so comfortable and has a warming soul that I felt safe.These two are huge assets to Investorade as Investorade is an asset to them ....and to everyone looking too sell or buy. They could have easily raked me since I was clueless and just flip it but Investorade is an honest company with a big heart and I wish the best for this new company and look forward to hearing more about them in the future!! and they are not just in the DFW area...the state of Texas and we know how big Texas is....! I truly can not say enough good things about this company. I will only refer to Investorade because  of who THEY ARE!"

My friend suggested Eco Movers, he loved their service for his move.

Once I received the OK to start walking on my ankle I signed up for a quote on a Tuesday; received a call and text to go over the specifics of the move that same day (way easier than I anticipated too). Their website made it easy to add the items from each room I would be moving.  Saturday their lead Landon and mover Daniel arrived and went to work.  They were a great team, they just knew what the tasks were and swiftly got everything I needed moved out.  They used drop runners so there wasn't a rainy shoe mess, wrapped up everything securely and we were off to my new place.  I appreciate the care that Landon and Daniel showed to ALL of my belongings.  They placed my things in their specific room and get it set up very close to how I wanted it so that I could start to use my new space right away.  It was still a mountain of boxes to go through, but doing so in a space that quickly felt like mine.

I appreciate the quick, helpful communication of their manager Jose.  The whole team was professional, easy to work with and cared about their clients stuff."

We found our dream home on day 1 of house hunting but we kept visiting the same shortlisted home again and again and again (atleast 5-8 times) before we locked in this home. All this while Matt & Ian were very patient with us and were available at all times very responsive to texts, calls, etc. Right from our first introduction meeting and all throughout the home hunt process (and even after) they are always open to answering questions, providing recommendations and going over and above to take care of their clients (now friends). They leave a lasting impact and create a personal bond with every client and that just gives us a safe space in this tedious process made really smooth by Matt & Ian. Right from locking in our dream home, to putting in an offer, negotiating with the builder, communicating fixes prior to closing, closing day tasks, etc. were all a breeze thanks to all the support and experience they got to the table. While we toured more than 20 homes before we locked in what we liked on Day 1, we always appreciated Matt & Ian's honest opinion about each home, which was an eye opener for a layman like me in the real estate market.

I whole heartedly recommend them to all in Seattle. I will also be approaching them for all future real estate needs. You guys rock! :-)"

They were giving full attention when passing through doors and staircases to not damage the wall edges. We felt pretty comfortable during the move. Jaime was an excelent driver and a great mover. He backed up a 26-foot truck to our narrow driveway super carefully. Marcelo gave an amazing help as well. The whole team worked in great harmony with each other and were super nice and polite during the entire move.
I booked my service over phone with Jose Garcia, from sales team. He was very helpful in explaining the deatils of move and how the pricing estimate works.

11123,0.23181367243867246,"My husband and I moved from the East Coast to Seattle and were keen to begin the process of purchasing a home. We had only been living in the city for about 6 months and knew that we would need extra guidance with navigating the real estate market in Seattle. Our previous realtor introduced us to Geoff, and right from our first consultation meeting we knew we would be in good hands with him. Geoff took the time to understand our needs, help us outline what we were looking for in a home and educate us about the neighborhoods that would be the right fit for us. Geoff is a true professional in every sense ‚Äì he is knowledgeable, genuine, straightforward, and easy to work with. He answered our endless questions in a timely and thorough manner. As we went on property visits, he stayed alert to our comments and would use them to refine our search criteria. Geoff helped us prioritize and assign the right value to the features and functionality we saw in the properties ‚Äì making sure that we wouldn‚Äôt have to compromise on our non-negotiable list of items. He provided us his unbiased feedback and would highlight things that might have gone unnoticed by us. Geoff is also super easy to connect with and has a fun personality. Within 3 months of our first Saturday touring open houses, we were ready to make an offer. We decided to go with a new construction house that was still in the process of being completed which brought some complexities with it. Geoff navigated us through the process with confidence and helped us visualize what the final properly would look like ‚Äì going the extra mile of even creating a 3D rendition of the house. He kept us in the loop every step of the way and made the entire buying process as stress-free as possible. We are now proud owners of a contemporary home in Queen Anne. If you are looking to buy a home in Seattle and want to work with someone who is smart, committed and an astute negotiator ‚Äì Geoff is the person to call! Thanks Geoff for all of your support and guidance! We look forward to having you over in the summer to enjoy and celebrate with some beers and bbq!"

9402,0.2314554814554814,"So my fianc√© and I just bought a house and we‚Äôre looking for movers to help move our furniture and stuff. I heard about Lazy Bear solutions through a couple of my coworkers who have used them before and also seen them on social media(IG). Since I needed help moving my furniture and stuff from my apartment to our new home, I decided to contact Lazy Bear Solutions through IG since that‚Äôs the only contact info given to me from my coworkers.
I spoke with Carlos and he was quick to respond. He asked me what I needed to move, what kind of apartment I had was staying to get the right truck for moving, what other services they do for the move, and the pricing. Carlos was super professional with the all the information about the move and equipment and how many people where gonna be helping with the move. He also stated he would be there himself to make sure everything is done right and would assist if needed to.
The day of the move he brought in a huge truck and a medium moving van. Both trucks had the ‚ÄúLazy Bear Solutions‚Äù name, info, and logo. Carlos and his team of 3 were amazingly courteous, professional, and knew what they were doing. They moved all my furniture within an hour. They placed wraps and tapes on the shelves for my dresser, padded wraps for my TVs, and handled the rest of our stuff with care.
When they arrived at our new house to drop off the furniture and stuff, they were equally as quick and professional when removing them from the truck and moving van. Carlos over saw everything and was interactive and awesome to have helping as well the 3 men that helped.
They finished the moving from the apartment to my new house in less 2 hours and he gave me a time frame of 3 hours to have everything done.
The pricing he gave was much less than the average I‚Äôve gotten from other companies I‚Äôve contacted. These guys were so awesome that I gave them a extra tip for helping with the move.
I would recommend them to anyone that needs help moving in general from one home to another. Professional, great pricing, amazing customer service and quick service that these guys are beyond 5 stars in my book. Carlos has also told me that they help deliver items that need pick up with assistance of a truck or van. Talk about a company that does more than just moving.
Thank you Lazy Bear Solutions for being awesome and helping us with this move!!!"

We worked with Rocky and he was ‚ÄúAMAZING‚Äù!  His knowledge of the market, patience, responsiveness and great personality made it so easy.  (Although Rocky always took my wife‚Äôs side, he was right.)
Rocky‚Äôs honesty saved us from buying the wrong home simply because we were focused on new construction and price point.  I would also like to give kudos to Chavi (she is boss) who assisted on the transaction as well.  Not selecting Team Diva would be a big mistake and we would recommend them in a heartbeat!"

I look forward to working with Angela again!!!"
8497,0.23089743589743592,My move was expedited with efficiency and professionalism. I called other movers with ridiculous prices. Wildcat Movers were the most reasonable and didn't overstaff my move with unnecessary people. I had a one bedroom and a washer and dryer and they did a great job. They estimated my move time exactly and got the job done on time. Ross and Royse handled everything in a professional and courteous manner. They moved my furniture with care and protective wrap and even had time to move everything on my patio which helped immensely. Daniel was my contact person who explained every detail of what the charges and fees would be for my move. I was charged exactly what was quoted. I highly recommend Wildcat Movers.

Sergey and his team arrived on time and got straight to work. They packed up my entire house quickly and efficiently, taking care to handle all of my belongings with care.

What I appreciated most about the team was their attention to detail. They listened carefully to all of my requests and made sure to comply with everything I asked for. They were fast but careful, making sure that everything was packed securely and safely for transport.

Once we arrived at the storage unit, the team worked just as quickly to unload and organize everything. I was impressed with their efficiency and professionalism throughout the entire process.

They had to wait about 1.5 hours after loading the truck because there was a slight delay in closing. I was stressed because my time was adding up but they were fast and even took half an hour off the final price. They are so efficient. I love that they wrap each piece of furniture, use padding for everything  and nicely put it back together. They have the best prices for the service they offer.

The Frogbox boxes are very sturdy and they also come with sticker labels that can identify what you pack in each box. We got the full package - 30+5, 2 wardrobes, and bubble wrap + packing sheets.

Clear and responsive communication - Marty helped me with the booking process and was clear with the quote, explained what would be covered, and helped me get the Certificate of Insurance that my building required. He also followed-up after to ensure I was satisfied. Great customer service!

Punctual - This is very much valued as someone who has lived in other cities and is frustrated by how many companies in Miami are notoriously late. They arrived on time and ready to go.

Efficient/Quick, yet careful - I had a relatively smaller move (equivalent of a studio move), but these guys handled the furniture with care, packed it well, and moved fairly quickly. Thank you Artem and Slava!

All in all, would highly recommend! It is incredibly difficult to find trustworthy moving companies in Miami with high quality customer service, transparent pricing, and most importantly, that are dependable and timely and these guys checked all the boxes."

11032,0.22710437710437711,As first time home buyers we had a positive experience with Harry Dhillon from Every Door Real Estate. He was very patient on explaining the process and answering our questions again and again. The market was competitive and he helped us set realistic expectations for our offers while being respectful of our budget. He was very responsive and was flexible on arranging showings with us. Be forewarned that Every Door Real Estate pays for reviews but I have not let that influence my rating.

6154,0.2270833333333333,"I had a job moving my belongings from a 10'x15' storage unit to a condo in Seattle. After submitting a request for quote, Eco Movers was prompt on responding. A professional and friendly representative reached out via initially an email then a follow-up call to work out the details and provide further information. The movers I worked with, Jevoy and Alex, were professional, friendly, and efficient. The whole process was exceptionally transparent and exceeded my expectations. I recommend Eco Movers."

Recommend their service to anyone making a move in and around Seattle!"
1209,0.2268939393939394,"Eco Movers crews are professional, on-time, and efficient. All three movers that helped me to move a 3-bedroom townhouse are hard-working.

11406,0.2268062397372742,"We recently bought a home with Walaw in a market with very low inventory and aggressive closures. Kim from Walaw was our broker and did an excellent job helping us find, and secure, a home.

Kim was a fierce proponent of our interests from the initial search, to final closing. She was thorough, aggressive in making sure we could bid quickly and competitively. She viewed all of our top picks in person with us, gave us insight from the MLS notes about the listing, and her recommendations on the type of things we should look for. I was most impressed with Kim in that I always felt she was not looking to quickly put us into a house, but rather finding the right house with us, and make sure we would be happy there for the long term. For me, that alone is what will keep me recommending walaw to my friends and family.

They responded quickly to email and phone calls, and were able to view properties with us on very short notice. She also was instrumental in helping us complete a very quick closing, wrangling our lender/the seller.

The only aspect of the service I didn't like was the home inspector (john) we used, which was on their list of recommended vendors, was not great. I wish I would have looked elsewhere for that aspect, but overall this is less their failing than his.

Overall, we saved a huge amount of money at closing, felt protected and in the hands of an advocate, and got the house we were looking for with minimal fuss in a difficult market for buyers. We will be using walaw again!"
3583,0.22678571428571428,"Wrightway was one of the best priced moving companies that I contacted and I was worried about the ""you get what you pay for"" to bite me later on, but that was NOT the case. I had three movers who worked from the second they got to my house until the last box was moved into the storage unit. I am moving into a house in a little bit and I will be using them again to move me. Very pleased with how professional they were and how efficiently they worked. Ask for the Gerzon crew!"

10904,0.22666666666666668,"I'd highly recommend WaLaw to people buying and selling in the Seattle area. Kim and her team took great care of us during our recent Queen Anne purchase, providing sound advice and counsel. On several occasions she advised against going ahead with an offer which showed she was committed to us as opposed to only committed to making a sale."

8335,0.22666666666666666,"Pros: Care taken to protect items from damage. Pleasant staff.

Cons: Could be much more efficient and organized, and bear customers time/cost in mind. A 1 bedroom apartment should not take a whole day to move within the same complex."

3192,0.22658102766798421,"Tod offers a new paradigm for buying and selling real estate.  It will save you a significant amount of time and money with the same services.  His automated process allows you to manage your listing online and will be listed in all the MLS and traditional real estate websites.  We have bought and sold many homes and have always used a traditional realtor with a 5%-6% fee and felt frustrated because it is rare that the listing agent will show your house or bring you a buyer.

Tod took great pictures of our home and offered excellent advice during the listing, contracting and closing process.  We couldn‚Äôt be more pleased with the outcome.  If you are having reservations about using a flat fee service, we can assure you the process feels exactly the same as using a traditional realtor without the huge commission and with the same success.  Our listing generated significant interest and the house had a contract on it within 2 weeks."
10822,0.2265625,"I am a first time home buyer and was introduced to Kim and her team of Diva's by a friend who has used her team twice now.  Kim walked em through all of the steps involved in purchasing a home and answered every question I had.  She met me at a few homes I was interested it (she didn't need to drive me; I don't expect people to drive me around all day looking at houses.  That's called entitlement!) and knew when to tell me ""No"" and when to say ""Yes!"".  I wanted the third house we looked at (I did all the research because only I know what I want.  I don't expect a near-stranger to know what my perfect house looks like.  That's called entitlement! Rude!).  She walked me through the financing and was present during the inspection too.  She even noted that the roof needed some help and negotiated with the seller to have it replaced.
Kim and her team are awesome and she earned every bit of the commission she received.  I guess what I'm saying is that if you expect your real estate agent to do everything for you, including picking out your house, maybe you should stay in Bellevue with your entitled ass.

8636,0.22653061224489793,The team was fast and efficient while being careful and attentive. I just stayed out of their way! Well worth the time and money to have our move done right. Watching Andy and his crew work was like watching a Cirque Du Soleil show -- so smooth and fluid.

It was three guys and a big truck and they managed and handled everything with much care and support.

3379,0.2263888888888889,"These guys helped me when I was in a jam.  The owner, David, is friendly and responsive.  I called him on a Saturday, and he had 2 guys ready to go on Sunday.  AM's movers are strong, thoughtful, and friendly.  They successfully moved multiple heavy, solid wood pieces of furniture into a house with narrow doors and hallways.  No scratches or damage!

AM Moving is easy to work with, and their rates are reasonable.  I would recommend them to anybody needing help with a move."

Andy and his crew were excellent. They were already familiar with the building I was moving out of and were  at the loading dock without me even having to show them where it was. They moved through the apartment efficiently and the move was done ahead of schedule."
7900,0.2260847107438016,"My wife and I recently sold our condo through Josh Paulus of Windermere. From start to finish Josh saw to it that any concerns we had were addressed and he regularly checked in throughout all the different phases of the selling process to make sure we were comfortable. This is the second time we've availed Josh's services, first when we were new to PNW and purchased our condo, and now with selling it. On both occassions we were thrilled with the outcome! Josh has become a good friend over the years and he is such a terrific guy all around! Admittedly, we were a little hesitant to list with the higher interest rates these days, but Josh reassured us that due to lack of inventory, he was confident we'd be able to find a buyer.

Outcome: We listed on a Thurs and held showings through the weekend. By Sunday evening Josh got back to us with two full cash offers 15k over asking and no conditions, and one financed also over asking no conditions. As you can imagine my wife and I were thrilled with the whole experience!

I 100% recommend Josh to anyone looking to buy or sell in the Seattle metro area.       üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü"

His honesty about houses traits that don't line up with your criteria is invaluable. This second round, I'd been rigorously touring houses for a bit over a month and hadn't found anything I wanted to offer on. There was no pressure to make an offer, just encouragement that the right house would come. Sure enough it did, and with Chris' guidance we were able to close under listing price! Looking forward to working with him again in the future. Thanks, Chris!"

In a very short time we were able to bring the property to market, we received numerous offers and within a few days we were able to narrow down the offers to several strong contenders.  In the end, we were able to choose an offer that met my expectations and closed quickly.  Kevin and his team are reliable and great to work with and they provide a team approach to the job.

I was a first-time home buyer new to the Seattle area and was glad that Danny really emphasized attention to detail, responsiveness, and providing as much relevant information as possible. Compared to other agents we initially spoke to who just wanted to show us homes or refer us to their lender of choice, Danny was always thoughtful, professional, and gave well-rounded responses. Even though our transaction is complete (buying) Danny still responds punctually to us for any questions and is always willing to help. If you're looking for an honest, competent, and insightful agent then we highly recommend Danny."
4739,0.22539682539682537,"We used both the packing and moving services. Both were awesome. Packers came the day before and paper wrapped everything. We only had breakage of two fragile wine glasses; amazing considering we had  a 2,000 sq ft home packed. The movers went above and beyond wrapping our large pieces, disassembling and assembling our beds and helping position our large items. The only improvement I would suggest is that the visually inspect the job before arriving the day of. Both teams had underestimated the size of the move; it was based strictly on sq ft and we have a lot of stuff after raising a family and 40 years of marriage."

I can't say enough about the job that our movers done. They were careful with all of our items and nothing was damaged during the move. Considering that Wildcat charges by the hour, I was worried about the potential lackadaisical efforts on the part of the moving team that we would be assigned. That was not the case with Ricky and Kel'. They both moved with a sense of urgency and care/caution and were strategic in the way that they handled the move. My Wife and I were impressed and we were grateful. We intend to request Ricky and Kel' on our next move, as well.

What I especially enjoyed is that the form on their website allows you to put in so much information before submitting for a quote. I was called the same day I submitted my information and they were extremely accommodating for my last minute changes. My movers were James and Brandon and they were very efficient and friendly! They were expected to arrive between 8:00 a.m. and 8:30 a.m. and they called me at 7:45 a.m. to let me know they were already nearby.

What really stood out with Kayla Preston was her ability to ""level set"" our understanding of the current market and where we should look for the hidden gems. She able to convey a realistic strategy on areas to target and type of home to put in the RIGHT offer. My wife and I hired Kayla and her team on the spot and got started right away. Kayla's team was highly engaged and responded to our all our questions immediately, and often go over and above and negotiating on our behalf. We felt that we were taken care of by a professional and was consistent up to the closing. Thanks again Kayla for making our buying experience a great one!"

His expertise, proficient handling of all related documents, his eagle eye relative to potential problems, his interaction with the seller, current tenants and potential buyers - his interpersonal charisma - stellar! I understand why he is rated number one - and my family and I overwhelmingly concur. Most importantly he is a realtor that has your back, and his attention to your concerns are more than transactional. He hears you - and works with all parties for an optimal outcome. Thank you Mr. Abraham Ash!"

The actual move went really smoothly! The team we had was Fidel, Daniel and Mileo, who were all fantastic. They wrapped up all the furniture, got it down 3 flights of stairs and into the truck, to the new place, and no damages anywhere. They actually finished 2 hours earlier than the estimate, they were so coordinated and efficient. I'll be going with eco movers again hands down."

The housing market is an aggressive one to navigate & both Matt & Ian are the right people to help you - they go over & above to make sure you have an edge while submitting an offer, and truly help swing things in your favor.

Both Matt & Ian are super friendly, extremely knowledgeable, organized & responsive.

We bought the first house we saw & loved but did tour a few houses with Matt over a weekend. His honest opinion during house tours was really appreciated & helped us gauge things from a different perspective.

They also own a construction company, so it was extremely helpful to have their perspective on how much it would cost to remodel stuff while touring houses.
Matt was also super helpful in getting us in touch with multiple local lenders for quick pre approvals.

Everything right from house tours, to putting an offer to closing was a seamless process for us!
Having worked with other realtors in past transactions, we could tell the stark difference in knowledge & professionalism while working with Matt/Ian. It‚Äôs no wonder they are so popular & came highly recommended by most of our friends.

Overall a fantastic experience and I would highly recommend this team to anyone looking to buy a house in Seattle & surrounding areas!"

For 6 months he worked tirelessly to help my wife and I find a house in the city, which is currently one of the worst markets in the country. With his persistence and know how we were able to find a house we love in the location that we wanted. Geoff was always available for questions or to take us on house tours. Even during a period where he was out of town, he made sure to connect us with one of his associate agents who took good care of us while he was away. Throughout the process he made sure that we felt like we were in the driver‚Äôs seat when it came to choosing what houses we wanted to see and what offers we put in, but all the while he backed us up with his extensive realty experience and detailed knowledge of the current market situation. When it came to offers he helped us create bids that were as aggressive as we were comfortable with and always supplied us with ideas, options and additional context on how to approach each one. Even on offers that did not go through we consistently received feedback that we were in top consideration. I think that is in no small part due to Geoff's guidance on what terms to offer. The Seattle market is unrelenting, but thanks to Geoff we were able to navigate the storm and come out on top."

I wouldn't have wanted anyone else other than Jeremy as my agent. When I started the process I was in the research phase of the home search, and I wasn't expecting to receive much attention from our agent--I wasn't actively looking to buy a home for at least 6-12 months. Jeremy was more than what I expected. He encouraged me to go see homes, to call him for questions, property interests, and thoughts about the real estate market. We started the journey together in April and by august 1st Jeremy helped us make an offer on a home. Jeremy is informed, competent, honest, and committed to your goals. This is a stressful process but Jeremy and Every Door Real Estate have made this experience quite enjoyable. I never felt pushed, alone, or ignored. If anything I worried I called too much.

They were done with the move within 5 hours, had I kept my mouth shut and not talked to them, it could have been 4.

The move included them wrapping all of our furniture, disassembling our beds and reassembling them. I‚Äôd highly recommend Dalton, Kel, and Tra for your moving needs to save on time and back pains. All 3 were professional, punctual, and took great care even with the non-fragile items. Megan the scheduling coordinator was very helpful prior to the move. Their virtual walkthrough was super convenient. She was responsive, friendly, and flexible with the dates as we worked around the completion of our renovations on the new house."

During this ordeal I had to think quickly on options, learning that the large box home appliance stores delivery service was absolutely awful. Which gave me an idea that using a private company would be a better option.

So after long research, I called AM Moving spoke with Joe and shared my urgent last minute option of a refrigerator pick up from the store, without hesitation, Joe was extremely patience and assure me once I was ready to give him a call back and they would help. I stayed in touch with Joe offering Updates.

We eventually cancelled the order from the box store retailer and widen our choices for a more customize selection of refrigerators

2 weeks later we finally located a state of the arts commercial refrigerator with a delivery date by 12-22-20. This company handle White Glove delivery ONLY...NO Assembly.

This refrigerator was extremely high tech so it required skilled professionals
to unpack, assemble and place in kitchen area, very delicate.

I spoke with Joe and gave him the updates and he gladly said too let him know day of delivery and he would reach out to one of his best team.

The Refrigerator arrived 7 days earlier, I  kept Joe updated and we schedule an appointment within 24 hours.

Louis & Jr. arrived on time , very clean, professional, with great personalities. They  were detailed and knew exactly what they were doing... they were not intimated with the refrigerator at all! Which was very very comforting.

The rate was great and we even TIP Louis & Jr for their outstanding service!

From financing, to location, to pricing strategies in an increasingly competitive market, Geoff helped me close on a location within a few weeks of our initial phone call.  He was even able to work in a handful of incentives that I had almost zero expectation of obtaining.  Most agents are looking to sell and move on to the next opportunity, but Geoff & team are more interested in creating long term relationships.  I truly can not recommend enough!"

Allison always got back to me and I never felt uncertain or lost in any of the viewing, inspections, reports and handling of financial and personal information. As a homeowner, I have dealt with realty agents in the past regarding the buy/sell process that did not correspond near as well and scheduled around their own specific needs. Not with Ms. Powers!

Though some things came up during the process, Geoff navigated through them with ease with the result getting me above listing price. On the purchase side, Geoff was very patient and full of useful insight. I never felt pressured to buy, despite viewing many homes. When the right opportunity finally came along, he moved swiftly and got us in well below listing. Even long after closing, when some legal issues came up (due to the sellers' agent not disclosing) Geoff still had old communications from their agent that were immensely helpful.

In fact, the home she helped us buy was one we say late on a Sunday night, which she put an offer in for us way past our bedtime!

10921,0.2223701298701299,"We recently had the pleasure of working with Matt, Ryan, and Marta to buy our first house in West Seattle. We chose Get Happy at Home because of their focus on education and knowledge of the market, and they exceeded our expectations! They guided us through a few dozen house tours while we calibrated our needs and desires against the realities of the Seattle housing market. Once we identified the right house for us, Matt put together a highly competitive offer, while keeping us safe by arranging a last-minute, 8 AM on Monday inspection of the house. We beat out 4 other offers, including one with a higher bid, thanks to Matt‚Äôs preparation and wealth of experience.

The one thing we‚Äôd change if we were starting over would be to discuss mortgage lenders earlier in the process. We hadn‚Äôt introduced one of our potential lenders to the GHAH team by the time we were ready to write our offer, so we ended up selecting one of their recommended lenders that they were confident would make our offer maximally competitive.

Buying a house is a huge commitment and a complicated process. We were glad to have knowledgeable experts like Matt and Ryan there to guide us through it. There are lots of ways you can buy *a* house. But to buy the *right* house for us, at the right price, Get Happy at Home proved invaluable."

If you want a well-priced & stress-free move, go with AM Moving.

10072,0.2213961038961039,"I did a lot of research before connecting with Danny. Having never bought a home before, it was important to find someone who's interest was beyond just selling a home. Not only was Danny able to provide answers for our myriad questions, he was an advocate for and partner in our home hunt.

After our first meeting he created a MLS rule to alert us about homes that fit our requirements. From there we'd just let him know which ones we wanted to see in person. Occasionally we'd find one on Zillow and he'd graciously take us out for a look. He seemed incredibly flexible to us. I know he had other clients but it wasn't apparent at all.

This is all pretty standard realtor stuff, I guess. But what really impressed my wife and I about Danny, and the reason we recommend him so highly, is that he'd look out for our needs even when we weren't. Many times we'd approach a home and he'd begin explaining things he saw that might be concerns for us later on. A part of me expected our agent to be working to get us into a home and close the sell. Danny worked to get us into the RIGHT home and make sure our needs were met.

When we did find that home he helped us strategize to win it in this INSANE market. With his guidance we beat out multiple offers. We couldn't be happier with the home or our experience with Danny. If you're looking for a buyer's agent, Danny has our highest endorsement."

Justin also spent a lot of time hosting open houses and ensuring it had good visibility.  Justin had strategy top of mind throughout the entire process and sold the condo much faster than expected.

10900,0.22045634920634916,"A quick breakdown of our house buying timeline:

Tuesday 4/26: Initially contacted Chris Kallin to see if he was available/interested in helping us find a house about 45 minutes south of Seattle. (For those of you in the Greater Seattle area, you know how tough and competitive the housing market is here).

Thursday 4/28: Chris came to our home and spent over two hours getting to know us, walked us through preliminary research based on our criteria, described in sufficient detail what to expect from the house purchasing process and set up an attainable goal for finding a house. Overnight he sent us a curated list of houses with his commentary for us to review.

Friday 4/29: We left our own commentary on the list of houses and requested tours for the weekend, which he scheduled with great considerations of everyone's calendars.

Saturday/Sunday: Toured 5 houses and trusted his expertise and advise on what to look out for in each property. That night we decided we wanted to put an offer on a house with a review date two days out.

Monday 5/1: Chris got on video calls and on the phone with us and worked diligently with the lender to prepare a strong offer.

Tuesday 5/2: Delivered offer in an extremely professional and timely manner and kept us updated throughout the day.

Tuesday afternoon: called us to tell us offer was accepted and started working on the necessary paperwork to start closing on the deal.

In short, Chris is an extremely diligent, detail- oriented, responsive, knowledgeable and energetic person. We had such a great experience working closely with him and could not have wished for a better agent. He provided great advice not just on the house buying process, but also on general homeownership. We feel very fortunate to have been able to trust and rely on him for what can be a very complicated process.

Regardless of whether you are a first time home buyer or a seasoned home owner you can truly rely on Chris to help you find your next home. We know we could not have done it without him and the fact that we were able to close a deal in such a short period of time was beyond our wildest expectations."
750,0.2204204204204204,"I worked with the agent Lili Glomstad. RECOMMEND!!

I‚Äôm a first-time homebuyer with zero knowledge on the research and the market. If you are just like me, Lili is the go-to person! You probably worry about the same things as I did: if the price is fair, if I have seen as much as out there in the market, if I trust this agent, and if there is anything I don‚Äôt know about and I missed it.

During the past two weeks, Lili has shown that all my worries are just too EXTRA.

Lili has established an excellent and thoroughly communication with me from the very beginning and to still today. She filtered out options per my exact requirements and patiently toured me to around 10 homes. She left very objective opinions on each home about the pro and con and once we locked on a target, she tried all she can to secure that home for me. She works tirelessly and make sure she answers my questions at the first second regardless nighttime or the weekends.

Because of Lili‚Äôs proactive working attitude and good tactics, we were able to lock down my first favorite home competing with other 4-5 buyers, and surprisingly we were NOT even the highest bidder.

And it‚Äôs not it yet, Lili also tracks down every detail of the contracts and agreements from both the seller and the Escrow. She found out three careless and unacceptable mistakes made by the Escrow and she pushed hard on these matters to get them resolved. It is a lifetime transaction and the numbers are huge. I am so grateful to have Lili to protect my interests and rights and stand strong by my side. TRUST is essentially the most important attribute in a buyer-agent relationship, and I can just completely trust and rely on her.

I am glad to announce that my purchase has been successfully closed today. I had a more than enjoyable time working with Lili, and I recommend all my friends to her when they need to purchase a home. In the future time, if I need to switch to a bigger house and she is still in the industry, she will be my first go-to person."

4939,0.22035509031198686,"We worked with The Every Door Team recently in buying our first home in Seattle. We came into this process very nervous with very little knowledge of the market of the home-buying process.
Kyle was beyond knowledgable, patient and helpful. Our first call he went through a deck of all the information we had to know and made things to straight forward and simple. Most importantly, as we started our search, we had very specific requirements that we did not want to compromise on. Kyle was never pushy and always looked for creative ways where we can find exactly what we were looking for. He was also always very honest, looking out for our needs and it felt like a true partnership every step of the way.
Our search was not easy where we lost on five houses due to the nature of the market (low interest rate, COVID, high demand, low inventory = perfect storm). Kyle was there to keep us motivated, help us tailor our offers each time to be more competitive and advise us how to get our home.
We are in the process of closing our first home and we cannot thank Kyle enough for the care and help and humor he showed the show process. The whole team at Every Door team was fantastic from the paperwork process to referring the right inspection team or lenders. Fantastic experience through and through and we cannot thank the team enough!"

Tod was knowledgeable in all areas of the real estate process, took really great photos and helped us sell our house in 2 days for more than we were asking. However, his assistance didn't stop there, he made sure everything stayed on schedule and was extremely responsive to all communications from both sides of the transaction. In assisting us with our purchase he was very open to providing his opinion when requested but also allowed us time and space to find the perfect home for us. He never made us feel rushed.

I've moved on a Sunday before, and the movers never showed up (All My Sons) and the office was closed on Sunday, so basically I was S-O-L. I was a little nervous in the beginning about ""paying by the hour"" as opposed to by the item (i.e. what if the movers were just standing around running out the clock), but that definitely was not the case with Lenzie, Levi & Deshun. They were go-go-go the entire time. They didn't even complain about having to move me out of a 3rd Floor walk-up, or that at my new 4th Floor apartment, the elevator wouldn't stay open and kept closing and going to the top floor w/o being prompted to do so.

The men were very professional and they did their best to move fast. Thanks again and I recommend this company.
6369,0.21777777777777776,"used Bradley to buy an out of state rental property in order to build my passive income. Bradley helped me analyze the numbers, check for important rental criteria, understand the local laws, and be my boots on the ground as an out of state investor. I bought this property during the crazy competitive market in 2021 and Bradley remained calm and focused during the whole process. He even negotiated that the seller pay all of my closing costs which was a great way to limit my cash outlay at closing. He helped me find a rockstar property manager in the area that does all the work for me. This property provides me stable passive income and has seen healthy appreciation since I bought it. I highly recommend Bradley and the House Hack Seattle team for all of your real estate investment goals."

4031,0.21766233766233764,"Isa and his team are awesome. This is my second time using the services of this moving company. They not only disassembled my furniture with care but wrapped each piece meticulously, taking care not to apply tape directly to the furniture surfaces - which I was satisfied with. I‚Äôd been concerned about the narrow stairs, fragile handrails, and freshly color-painted walls of my new home so I kept watch on the move. They successfully relocated all my possessions without touching the walls at all, and without a single scratch left behind! I have to admit their work truly remarkable. Moving home is so grueling but if I ever have to do it, I will unquestionably choose them again."
10594,0.21766233766233764,"I started a conversation with Geoff about buying my first home somewhere around four years ago, and along the way he's exhibited more patience than I imagined possible in a human being, let alone a real estate agent. Every step of the way, his top priorities were making sure I was well informed and comfortable with the pace things were moving. I'd email him a question like, ""Hey, what about house boats?"" or ""what do HOA dues cover?"" and receive a prompt and amazingly thorough reply every time. When it came time to actually look at places, he was immediately responsive each time I found a candidate, and totally understanding each time I rejected one. Not even ever once for a single tiny moment did I feel any pressure to hurry up, and he always had a way of making me feel like I knew what I was doing. Now I live in the exact place I wanted. I've already recommended him to a friend, and will continue to do so. If you have the chance to hire Geoff, it would be a mistake not to."

You wake up and hope that the new day brings forth something exciting‚Ä¶. Well, that‚Äôs how I felt when I found Richr.com!  They were ready to list my home for FREE! Sounds unbelievable, but it is TRUE!!

What really amazed me is Serena!! Serena is not only a JOY to work with, she is also passionate about helping homeowners like myself have a positive and rewarding experience. Serena patiently advised me at all steps of the listing process. She even referred me to a professional photographer who I hired directly to take beautiful interior and drone photographs to market my home. All the processing was done electronically and very efficiently. There were even times when I discussed listing options I had used in the past and Serena promptly researched the topic and responded, sometimes even on a weekend!

Serena and Wendy were extremely diligent in sending me all the leads generated through my listing. They provided me timely reports when I requested for additional market research information. They have the experience and knowledge to be a valuable asset throughout. Being detailed oriented myself, I feel very fortunate to have found Richr. It has been such a great wavelength match and a positive experience, I couldn‚Äôt dream for more. Their response times, attention to detail and professionalism is incredible.

Bryan, Miguel, & Ariel were the 3 men sent by Mancav Movers. These men were cheerful and fun. They were extremely careful with our belongings, and as promised all our furniture items were blanket wrapped and the more fragile items cardboard wrapped. The chemistry of the team was amazing.

10446,0.21704465287798622,"Being first-time homebuyers, we couldn't have gone with a better broker than Geoff!  Because of him (and a bit of luck), we are now new homeowners of the first and only home we put in offers for, and we couldn't be more grateful!  There are so many qualities that we appreciated about Geoff, but for the sake of brevity, we'll share the ones that really stood out to us:

From the start, Geoff was very clear about the methods of communication depending on the level of urgency.  Because of this, we knew exactly what medium to use to get the information we needed (e.g. email, cell, or call).  No guessing.  There was only one day where his schedule didn't allow him to personally show us a home, but his partner Kelly stepped right in and had tours all scheduled on our preferred day.  At no point in time did we feel like we couldn't reach either of them.

He asked us questions to gauge whether or not we had unrealistic expectations so that he could help set realistic ones.  Navigating a seller's market as a buyer was not an easy thing to do, and Geoff prepared us for this by sharing possible scenarios, which made rejections (luckily we only had one) that much easier to handle.

Geoff let the homes speak to us instead of speaking about the homes.  We asked him early on in the process what we should expect from him since we had not done this before, and he was clear that he wasn't the type of agent to push his clients to buy.  This was one of the biggest decisions of our lives, and it was so refreshing to know that we wouldn't be pressured into buying a home that we wouldn't love or one that wouldn't be right for us.

He would bring attention to certain parts of a home he felt were concerning, and alternatively would also point out things he thought were good qualities.  Because the home we bought was actually one that he couldn't show us personally, he even went back and shot a video of his walkthrough with comments!  After viewing a number of homes with Geoff we quickly realized that he had high standards for homes (for good reasons), and we could tell that he was looking out for us.  Therefore, knowing that we bought a home that had his ""stamp of approval"" reassured us that we were making a sound decision.

When it came time to put in an offer, he explained the reasons behind every number and ultimately let us decide on what numbers we were comfortable with.  We weren't pushed into agreeing on amounts we couldn't afford, which is so important since we are the ones that have to make those payments.

It was made clear from our offers that Geoff was there to protect us and our money.  We weren't encouraged to waive any rights/contingencies that didn't make sense.  Instead, he focused on strategically making our offers more attractive/impressive, which is ultimately why we ended up getting our home over another buyer that offered a higher amount than we did initially.

Early on, we felt very overwhelmed by all of the lender options out there, and we're so glad that we went with a recommendation of Geoff's.  Because he had experience working with our lender, they kept each other informed about everything during the closing process, making it more streamlined and straightforward for us to follow along.

Although there is more we can speak to regarding Geoff, even with the short amount of time that we worked with him, ultimately what mattered to us was that he helped us buy a home that we will love for a while to come.  Thank you!"

She and the Every Door team have now helped us on two purchases, both with different situations and challenges.

Katie provided honest insights based on our goals and needs, and answered all of our questions without making us feel like we should know better. She helped us craft offers that would help us position well in very different market conditions, and did I mention she is incredibly responsive!

On the day of the move they showed up early and ready to work. They even found a faster route inside our own apartment to move furniture, resulting in a faster move. Enrique and Joshua  wrapped and padded everything for us so we felt safe keeping our furniture in storage. They had mattress coverings to buy and a tv box to purchase which was a life saver. Me and my boyfriend were already running around doing so much for our move that they completely took the stress out of moving our more expensive items like our TV. They even had a operation manager on sight who watched over the first part of our move which made us feel extremely taken care of.

I stumbled on this site through a simple Google search and have been very pleased with the quality and descriptiveness of the site. I write this review as someone who has NOT purchased a house but who has been so impressed with my experience that when I do (probably in a couple of years) I will 1000% work with RJG Realty Group and recommend him/them to my friends and loved ones ""in the market"" for a house in the meantime. I recommend YOU do TOO, let me explain why:

1. I have a weird curiosity about the real estate market and like to research homes for sale and property values in my spare time ( I know I am weird and I blame HGTV lol) and of all the websites I have experienced this one is by far the most informative and useful.
2. When you subscribe you get daily emails of 3 types - new homes on the market, price changes on current homes, and homes that are pending contract.
3. The website is extremely easy to use on both the desktop version and mobile site (some real estate sites are so anti user-friendly and bogged down with search ""tools"" that using their tools is more of a pain than it is worth, especially on a mobile platform)
4. Rawlins takes pride in his website and he noticed my daily use of it and took time to reach out personally to ask if I was in the market. Although I am not, I really appreciated being acknowledged promptly. All communication has been friendly and attentive!"

Maybe even better than before! Because of them I will be using Wildcat for any future moves, and will refer others in need as well. Thanks again boys!"

3634,0.21541666666666667,"I‚Äôm not entirely displeased with my experience with this moving company but some things could have been better. This was my very FIRST time ever hiring ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù movers so I had no idea what to expect. My experience with Jenny was great. She provided a clear and understanding explanation of the pricing and what I should expect when my moving date came. The movers came around 12:30p and I received a call from the main mover who needed help finding my apartment, which was fine. I had no problem doing that. The second they opened the door, I smelled marijuana. I didn‚Äôt care at this point, it was 90 degrees outside and I was exhausted already. What they do is none of my business, I just hoped they would do a good job the way I was told they would. They shrink wrapped my dresser which was already duct taped so the drawers wouldn‚Äôt open and also my glass table that was wrapped with a blanket and duct taped. I didn‚Äôt know that it would have been $5 an item. Again, none of that mattered because I just wanted this day to end. Upon signing the final bill, I was given a piece of paper to fill out, which I did. It wasn‚Äôt until I got inside that I saw 2 scuff marks on my entertainment stand. Not checking before I signed anything is my fault but these are ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù movers who obviously didn‚Äôt care about the well-being of MY furniture. The overall experience was ok but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd use them again after everything I witnessed. All of these awesome reviews and I had hoped to have the same experience."
7385,0.21535087719298246,"Doron and team met and exceeded our expectations.  I am confident you will have a good experience if you utilize Doron for your next transaction.

There are a few things that I consider table stakes when working with a realtor.  He/she has to be responsive, professional and have a mastery of the process and local market conditions.  However, it is the next layer of skills that helps maximize your buying and selling potential.  Those skills include creativity, networking and negotiating.

Doron was able to provide us with creative strategies for both identifying potential homes for purchase and in preparing our current home for sale.  Doron provided valuable insight into sellers' motivations that ultimately allowed us to understand what leverage, if any, we had when placing an offer.  His advice allowed us to be competitive without pushing us out of our budget.  In preparing to sell our home, Doron was able to point out several simple to intermediate home improvement projects that would make the biggest impact on buyer perception and get the home sold efficiently.

Doron's networking ability was crucial in getting us through the process efficiently.  He was able to provide reliable recommendations for lending, inspection, cleaning and painting services.  I am sure the list would be longer if we had asked!  Not to mention the large network of past and prospective clients in the area that can be utilized to improve the marketing of your home.

Finally, negotiation skills are important to getting a to fair deal that works for both parties.  Doron did a good job of laying out the different levers available to us in the offer process and in managing the back and forth that typically ensues to ensure we maximized the transactions on our side, while working respectfully with the other party.

Choosing the right realtor is key.  Doron and his associates have shown a mastery of the expected skills.  More importantly, he will utilize his creativity, network and negotiating skills to help you have the best experience possible!"

10181,0.21526190476190474,"My partner and I engaged the services of Geoff Hill because others gave him consistent excellent reviews. Even though we were outside the US at the time and we had not met face to face, he went out of his way searching for potential homes, taking videos and sending virtual reviews together with his comments about the home and neighborhood, all of which helped tremendously because of our limited knowledge of the individual suburbs of Seattle, we quickly learned during our initial visit to rely heavily on Geoff's inputs. Once we were in Seattle, we were impressed at how promptly he responded to calls, messages and decisions to view individual homes, even on short notice. More importantly, he never pressured us to buy a home we did not like but he expeditiously assisted me when we found a house we would eventually call a home. Throughout this process, we understood clearly why Geoff received excellent reviews - he is professional, prompt and would go the extra mile for his clientele. We highly recommend Geoff Hill."

He met with us, gave us some good ideas to keep in mind, and left us by just telling us to reach out when ready. When that moment finally happened over a year later, Justin was available right away and immediately helped us to get ready - mentally and physically - to get our house ready to sell!

It was apparent right away that Justin understood the market and took time to understand our goals as well. We felt confident that Justin‚Äôs integrity, diligence and expertise would help us get the deal we were hoping for. Justin helped us understand the market conditions and strategize the asking price to maximize the views of the listing. It worked out as planned. He and the Wagner team were professional, kept us up to date on our deadlines and goals, and did everything they promised. Justin even came to the photo session and swept pine needles off our driveway to make sure it looked perfect!

Justin and his team promoted our listing well with multiple open houses.  To our surprise, we had multiple offers over asking price within two days of listing!

We appreciate that Justin understood our goals and timeline and helped match those to the closing terms. He went the extra mile to make sure we had multiple offers and got the best deal possible, closing on a Sunday night (with his parents in town!). He worked extra hard to make the whole process - start to finish - easy for us.

11916,0.21427051671732517,"Dallas Contemporary Homes helped make our long time dream become a reality! My wife and I have been married for a very long time, and it's always been a dream of ours to own our own home. Back in 2019, we decided that 2020 would be our time to take ownership and pay OUR mortgage. We came across Dallas Contemporary Homes (The RJG Realty Group at the time), and Rawlins reached out to introduce himself to us.

After communicating back and forth for a bit, we could tell that Rawlins seemed genuinely interested in not only listening to our wants, but also addressing our concerns. We'd spoken with other real estate ""professionals"" in the past, but many of them only seemed interested in rushing us through the process to collect a paycheck. Life happens, and we did not have the best credit to begin with, but Rawlins assured us that he had the right people in his network to get us where we needed to be. We assured him that if he guided us, then we'd follow his lead, because we were fully committed to getting into a home of our own.

When our scores were where they needed to be, Rawlins and Dallas Contemporary Homes continued to impress, as we were connected with an ALL STAR lending team (Team LendFriend) who really took care of us on the financing side of things! They worked with us to get us the best possible rate and to make sure we fully understood what we needed to know about the home loan process. Against the recommendation of Rawlins we ventured out to find another lender beforehand, and it turned out to be nothing but overstated promises with poor delivery. We see why Team LendFriend is the go to lender for Dallas Contemporary Homes!!

During the actual home shopping process, Rawlins and his amazing expertise glowed like the sun, because he helped us find a home that checked nearly ALL of our boxes while staying within our budget. He not only did that, but he negotiated an UNREAL deal for us in an EXTREMELY competitive market. Folks, all those reviews that reference Rawlins' communication and negotiation skills are 100% truthful. Even his own preferred lender is oftentimes shocked at the deals he gets for his clients!

Ginger, the Client Care Director stayed in close contact with us to help navigate all the key dates and communications of the deal. She really makes sure to keep the client apprised of the need to know components that will get the deal from contract to close. The deal was so incredible that we ended up getting money BACK at closing!! Between the amazing work the lending team and Rawlins did, we saved over $20k OUT OF POCKET on our purchase!

This was a long review, but we wanted to share our testimony with the world. If you're even THINKING of buying a house, then do yourself and your family a favor and reach out to Dallas Contemporary Homes. THEY WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL! Take it from us!

Thank you so much Rawlins and the entire Dallas Contemporary Homes team for believing in us and guiding us home."

It really was a blessing in disguise that we didn't get that first home with the other agent.

She gave us a thorough consultation and even connected us with a reputable lender to increase our purchasing power. Lili took time to really understand our needs and asked us the right questions to help us figure out what we were really looking for. Weeks later, we were in a multiple offer bid situation again. But this time, with Lili's help and expertise, we were able to get a better home with less money in the same community! And we were not the highest bid!

4125,0.21225490196078434,"This is my 4th time working with Kayla Preston but the first time she helped me personally find a home. I am a financial planner. I was first introduced to Kayla in 2018 by a lender I worked with who assisted my clients with their mortgage. They also needed an agent, and this lender said Kayla is the one and only person they should consider. I quickly learned why as she helped my clients quickly secure a home during a bidding war. I referred two other clients to Kayla who both had equally successful experiences.

Fast forward to 2023 when my wife and I were ready to buy our first home. Without hesitation I knew Kayla would need to be our agent. She went above and beyond throughout each step of the process to educate us on what to expect and prepare us to make a competitive offer once we found out home. We were able to secure a home at under list price in a highly competitive part of Seattle WITH inspection contingencies and repairs! I can't imagine using anyone else for my clients or my families future home purchases."

Angie and I spoke while they were doing a move up in Seattle. After that Jeff and I spoke on a number of occasions to solidify the move.

11352,0.21077888621235394,"I LOVE SHARON ASHLAYA @ Dallas Luxury Realty!!!

I live in Uptown (Freedman Town) and needed a new place that matched the lifestyle that I am accustomed to.  I met Sharon by happenstance, doing an independent search for condos, and calling the realtors whose names were on the condo listings to express interest in the properties.  I let her know my needs, and where I was currently living.  She offered to be my realtor in that same call, and got to work right away.

Sharon not only has the powerful skill of pulling out a client's vision for their future home, she is also incredibly intuitive about our needs and is amazingly knowledgeable about any property we may have interest in.  She is efficient and effective, ensuring that we focus on units that truly inspire us and won't be a waste of our time.  She is also extremely determined, hard-working and passionate.  I received a call from her every morning with updates and a clear plan of attack for the day.  She is very hands on and attentive.  My favorite characteristic about Sharon is her candor; she is straight-up with me, and that is my kind of people.

I've worked with a lot of realtors in a several different cities: Atlanta, New York, and Dallas, and Sharon is by far my favorite, hands down, no contest.  I felt like I knew her for years in just a matter of minutes during our first call.  Whenever I need a realtor again, SHARON IS IT.

I highly recommend her and Dallas Luxury Realty.  Thanks Sharon!"
11031,0.21071428571428572,"We had no idea what we were doing when we embarked on the journey of home ownership. Geoff eased us into the process and ensured that what could have been an anxiety-ridden experience was exciting, pleasant, and methodical. With minimal spare time to view homes or research neighborhoods we relied heavily upon Geoff to preview listings and narrow our focus on the properties that truly met our wants and needs. After viewing less than a dozen houses we found our home. The house we fell in love with was listed as a short sale. Short sales have a propensity for delays, interruptions and red tape; Geoff was transparent about these possibilities when we made our initial offer. Employing his charm and real estate savvy, Geoff handled our end of the sale with a nimbleness that ultimately won us our home‚Äîin just six weeks! Geoff exemplified dedication and perseverance throughout the sale, even completing a final work item on the exterior of the house that the seller had failed to do‚Äîa critical step in the final hours of securing our loan. Even our loan officer was impressed, stating that Geoff ‚Äúhas been just terrific. Quality representation of your interests, and great follow up on the loan needs, every step of the way.‚Äù I could not have said it better myself. Prior to this experience I had my own preconceived notions about realtors. Geoff quickly squashed these stereotypes and proved himself to be very authentic and genuinely interested in helping us discover and purchase the perfect home."
2017,0.21071428571428572,"If you are in Seattle, you need to book with these movers. We had Thomas and John unload for us on a hot Sunday (when the rest of the city's movers are typically closed and don't do moving services). They treated our stuff like it was their own. They were so careful and courteous, and on top of it, fast. They accommodated every request and constantly asked questions about where we wanted things and what we were comfortable with. They also took careful note of anything we marked as fragile without us even having to say anything. I can't think of anything I wish they had done better. They were truly professional."

They were absolutely amazing!!!
My only problem was the management of Ecomovers were not up front with how the time window worked. I was told that the movers would be there 12-4 and I assumed that was the window of my moving time. But was then told after 12 that they would be there sometime between 12 and 4. There also was some confusion with who my movers were."

He and his team were very responsive and willing to communicate and meet according to my preferences and schedule over several  months. He pulled together multiple last-minute pre-inspections for me, helping me decide and move forward in multiple-offer scenarios with tight deadlines. He also greatly facilitated communication with the property's builders after the offer was accepted. His ability to help move the process forward without making me feel pressured into a decision was invaluable."

What we didn't plan on was a worldwide pandemic and a looming Stay-At-Home order.  Thank goodness for Rob McGarty and his Bushwick team. Rob walked us through the pros and cons of moving forward or waiting, gave us up to the minute government requirements regarding whether or not real estate was considered an ""essential business"" (it was), and in general was in front of the entire surreal process. So, in addition to his regular duties as our Real Estate Agent, he quickly became our go-to source for calm assurance that he understood the situation, the incredibly dynamic market, and what our hopes were for the house. We put the house on the market on the day/date and price he recommended and within 36 hours we had a full price offer. As a fun aside, if you search Rob, KUOW/NPR stories and ""Can you see yourself being quarantined here?"", you'll see our kitchen.
TL;DR: Get yourself the incredibly smart & experienced R/E team of Bushwick!"

It's hard to imagine a scenario that Rob has not encountered. He has a wealth of knowledge and experience, which really helps to ease the home-buying jitters. I always felt that my best interests were the priority when working with Rob and his team. There is no question I will enlist their help in the future when I sell or buy again!"

4872,0.20952380952380953,"Amazing moving service from Pure Moving! Scheduling the move was quick and easy online, and the team at Pure reached out to me right away with some follow up questions about my move. After talking to Pure Moving, I chose to hire a team of 4 movers and a truck. Pricing was very clear, with no hidden fee's or upcharges.

Prior to the move, communication was great. They confirmed my move, then a couple days before my move contacted me for a final confirmation. The morning of the move, they called to let me know they were on the way, and the team arrived on time.

Bagrat and his team were super professional and very efficient during the whole move. They arrived with all the equipment needed to make the move quick and painless. They treated all my belongings with care, had plenty of large wardrobe boxes both for hanging clothes and also to efficiently store and move smaller items. Every piece of furniture was wrapped in plastic or moving blankets, and the corners were taped up to prevent any damage. They very carefully wrapped up TV's to ensure no damage. They even took apart my bed and put it back together on the other side.

At the end, the move took 6 hours from start to finish. The invoice was clear, and again no surprise charges for anything, just the hourly rate and truck fee that were quoted when we booked the move.

Highly recommended!!"

Furthermore, the actual movers were outstanding. Damar, Ricardo, and Brian absolutely killed it! They were quick, professional, took their time where needed and had an outstanding attitude. Very happy and will use Phoenix for all of our moves in the future.

Update: we have now used Phoenix express for 3 moves and 2 packing jobs, including one that had two different locations, two trucks and a 4 hour drive. They always exceed expectations. They have people that have worked with them for a long time, which speaks volumes to their employers. We appreciate the familiar faces. Hats off to you guys!"
3646,0.20944444444444446,"Stellar movers, they were on time and very professional. There was an incident with a television that was completely cracked and when I called to inform the owner, not requesting money back simply an acknowledgement of what happened he was rude, out of line and unprofessional. I don't think it's appropriate to cut someone off repeatedly as they are speaking and much less not even apologizing. If you are seeking a company with great customer service, perhaps look elsewhere. With that being said, the three movers that were NOT the owner were amazing and beyond professional. I want to make sure that is highlighted. The problem here is the owner."

He even worked with us while he was on vacation! He made us feel so comfortable and confident that we made an offer and went under contract on our new home sight unseen.

8734,0.20848794063079776,"I recently completed the purchase of my first home, and Geoff Hill was nothing short of essential during the crazy, hectic process of buying a house in the Seattle area. I was a first time home buyer and I now have a new understanding of how crucial it is that you choose a strong partner as your realtor. My process involved 3 months of searching, 2 accepted offers that did not pass inspection, and a 3rd (and final) accepted offer that had bump after bump along the road to closing.

During the countless home tours, Geoff ALWAYS treated me as his top priority. The story doesn‚Äôt stop there‚Ä¶ any time, day or night, Geoff made himself available to ensure that I had the support I needed to evaluate potential options, make offers, schedule tours and inspections, and eventually make every move needed ahead of schedule to ensure an on-time closing. In addition to Geoff‚Äôs availability, I had the pleasure of working with his partner, Kelly, who was just as supportive and knowledgeable on the rare occasion that Geoff was not available for a house tour.

Geoff guided me away from a handful of options and never forcing my hand, demonstrating how he is absolutely NOT commission driven as many others are, but truly cares about my well-being. Geoff‚Äôs impact was most heavily felt during my process of making offers and evaluating counter-offers. His level head, strategic mind, and strong advocacy on my behalf significantly boosted my confidence, ensuring that I provided the best offers and counters possible, perfectly balancing between aggressive and fair.

I cannot thank Geoff enough for his support and would strongly recommend that you stop your search for a realtor right now and commit to working with Geoff Hill."
11979,0.20848484848484852,I wanted to share with anyone that may be skeptical about free MLS listing offers by Richr. I was selling by property by owner when I was recommended to call Richr to have the property listed for free in the MLS. When I reached out and spoke with Serena she politely and patiently explained how it worked and I decided to worked with them. Upon Richr listing the property I received dozens of calls from realtors of which I received offers and the property was sold to buyers coming from the listing. Absolutely amazing and positive the service and experience I had with Richr and totally and really for free. I definitely recommend Richr to everyone that wants to sell there property. I am really grateful and appreciative to Serena and Richr for all there help and assistance through my process from A to Z in the sell of my property. Thanks

Rob asked detailed questions about what we liked and didn't like and was able to quickly hone his suggested properties to those we would like.  We would often find a property in an email from a real estate site only to have it already in our text messages from Rob.  He was able to work with our crazy hours to visit homes after dinner before kid bedtime and made the most of our short windows by planning how to attack the properties we wished to see each evening.  His insights during tours were extremely valuable and helped us see the good and the bad of each property.  During our offer process he was able to give solid advice and made the process as easy as possible.  We won't be buying again for quite some time (I hope), but if we were to, we would use Rob again without question.  We're telling all our friends to also use him.  So should you."

11561,0.20773133116883116,"We had an extremely positive experience working with Rob and Bushwick on the purchase of our first home and would absolutely recommend him. We had specific preferences about the home and were experiencing a bit of a learning curve but Rob was very understanding of our priorities, and willing to wait until the right home came onto the market- we did not feel rushed whatsoever. In the meantime we viewed a few houses for educational reasons and Rob and Bushwick were very generous with their time in walking us through things to consider. When the right house appeared, Rob noticed it before we did and was able to get us into a viewing with an offer to the buyer within 24-48 hours. We trusted his experience regarding how to approach various aspects of the post-offer process and felt well taken care of due to the excellent customer service from Rob and Bushwick. Even after the sale completed he has checked in on us as we are navigating rent-back, our upcoming move, and finding local businesses for cleaning,  etc. We hope you will consider him for the purchase of your home!"

I am aware of several in hot Seattle which have languished on the market under Trelora for months unsold which Trelora is not listing on their own page but are showing as Trelora on Zillow.  This company hides how many properties it cannot sell and they make make zero effort beyond just putting it on the MLS.  Every decent realtor lists his track record.  Where is yours?  Where is the list of what you have sold and what you have on the market and where is the list of how many clients have given up on you not selling anything and gone to a real professional realty?  This company never bothers sending a realtor to showings, refuses to do Open Houses and makes endless excuses why a house does not sell.  Get a real realtor if you want to sell a house.  These guys promise the moon and deliver nothing."
11100,0.20759199134199138,"In late 2017, I began looking for a home in a very casual way because I had a home that I loved, but really needed something bigger.  Remington had recently joined Team Diva and assured me that he could help find the right home for me in a market that was very competitive.  I would need to sell my current home to purchase a new one, and needed to do it in a way that would not prejudice the quality of my offer (no seller would ever accept an offer on their contingent on selling another home in the hot Seattle market!).

Just as he promised, at the start of 2018 Remington found a great new home that met all my search criteria.  And more importantly the situation was one where I could actually get my offer accepted.  The new home had not yet gone on the market, which meant that I could make an offer without having to compete against other buyers.  The home builder was also willing to give me additional time to close the sale of my existing home.  Everything worked out great and I've been very happy in my new pad :)

Oh, and once we had the offer accepted on the new home, Remington worked with me to get my existing house on the market in a just over a week (decluttering and staging), which gave me some extra cushion in timing for the close of the new home.  And we even managed to sell my existing home for more than asking, which definitely helped with the purchase of my new home."

Everyone was professional and more importantly courteous.  Treating others with respect is a hard to find gesture lately.  This team of professionals handled every conversation and task in a courteous manner.  Except for the last check from my tenant. Per the contract that check was to be sent to me.  Before the ink dried I was on my own trying to get my payment.  I guess a grand is pennies in the grand scheme of things in the deal. At least from their perspective."

A satisfied client."
5303,0.20714285714285713,"We had a great experience with Every Door.  Wouter was the third agent we worked with and he was head an  shoulders above the others.

5247,0.20710056227297605,"I have never had such a wonderful moving experience before.  I used Pure Moving Company over this past weekend, and I was HIGHLY IMPRESSED.  Zach and his team had an arrival window of 8am - 9am and they showed up on time at 8am - already off to a great start.  They performed the entire move expertly and with lightning speed.  Even though I had 3 flights of stairs, by 9am they had mostly packed up my 2-bedroom condo completely.  I was blown away.  When the team arrived at my new home, they also unpacked with lightning speed.  There was no damage to any items, no damage to the condo we left and no damage to the new home.  They even layed down protective flooring so as to not get either home dirty, as it had rained the day before.

The entire move was completed HOURS sooner than I thought it would take!

The most noteworthy thing that happened, is, I was anticipating a particular chair to be difficult to get out of a room (and also into the new home)... as the movers I hired when I moved into my condo (not from Pure Moving) could not figure out how to get the chair in, and eventually had to take a door OFF the wall.  Zach and his team at Pure Moving Company however, figured out how to get this chair in and out of rooms without having to take the door off the wall!  It was INCREDIBLE!  So it goes to show, Zach and his team have more knowledge and experience moving furniture than other movers and other companies.  Therein lies the proof.

If I ever have to move again there is no way I'd hire anyone other than Pure Moving Company.  Quite simply the BEST there is.  I couldn't be happier."
6611,0.20700757575757572,"Working with Matt, Ian, and Amber was very fun. They helped us find our new condo in downtown Seattle. They listened to what we wanted and we didn't feel any push to see what we didn't like. They were all very responsive and easy to work with. As we were new to the area, we appreciated their input on the future value on some condos or their knowledge of the condo builders and quality of their work. Highly recommended."

I asked for a discount as I had lost 2 hours of my day and was running late to turn in my apartment keys to the office. Daniel did not want to give me a discount, after a few minutes he decided all he could do for me was a $20 discount. Unfortunately, my experience with wildcat movers was not as great as everyone else. I chose to rate more than one star as my movers were kind and gentle with my items and did a good job."

I moved from a 4 bedroom TH to a 4 bedroom SF. Both properties had stairs and it was not an easy move. The team lead by Bryan showed up early with crazy positive energy and they knocked it out of the park. These guys treated my furniture like it was their own. I chose them because of all the 5 star reviews and they got it right. Mancav has won my business for life.

We needed to move across country and find a home in a weekend.  We walked off the plane on Friday and they had us looking at houses within an hour.  They are truly a team and understood the time pressure and worked together to find us our new home.  They provided us honest insight into the neighborhoods and showed us the growing areas.  They guided us on making an offer beyond the standard information. On a personal side they were just plain fun to work with and the attention they showed was phenomenal.  They managed to find us a home and helped us close in record time. I worked with many realtors in different states and not all of the are equipped to work with relocation.  Chavi and the whole team are more than capable.  I have no doubt if the need arises, I will work with them again."

He was very understanding of our search criteria and we couldn‚Äôt have closed as quickly as we did without him! As first time home buyers, Justin patiently answered all our countless questions and successfully negotiated our offer including repairs and contingencies with the owner. Justin has strong network and introduced us to a lender who pre-approved us quickly and was able to close earlier than initially expected. We definitely recommend Justin to anyone looking to purchase real estate and look forward to working with him in the future."

4188,0.20550000000000004,"Phoenix Express handled my move from Dallas, TX to Birmingham, AL. I reached out to multiple independent and franchise moving companies for quotes, and Phoenix offered a competitive price with a price guarantee - which no other firm offered. On moving day, they showed up with a team of packers/loaders led by Alex, who is an excellent communicator and coordinator. The team had my 3 bedroom 2 bathroom house packed and loaded several hours ahead of schedule. They arrived in Birmingham ahead of schedule, and unloaded into an apartment and storage unit - again ahead of schedule. The team treated my possessions with care, perfectly coordinated logistics and communicated them to me, and delivered ""white glove"" type service. I cannot provide high enough praise for their work. A long-distance move is very stressful, and Phoenix Express took the stress of packing, loading, and logistics away - and the price guarantee ensured that I stayed within my moving budget.

I highly recommend reaching out to Jeff at Phoenix Express for Dallas-area moving assignments, both local and long-distance. Jeff is responsive, honest and professional during his quoting process, and Alex and his team deliver first-class service throughout the move itself. This is an emphatic 5-star review."

The movers (Eli, Dontae & Luis) arrived right on time, expertly & carefully wrapped up all the furniture in my 2 BR apartment, and then surgically repacked it into a 10x15 foot storage unit, all in the same day.

7141,0.20515873015873018,"After having such a great experience with Geoff when he helped us buy our house, we wanted to go to him first when we decided to start looking for commercial real estate for our farm brewery. Even though the majority of his work was in residential real estate, we knew his professionalism and dedication meant we'd be in good hands. Over the next 22months, Geoff met us at properties all over farm lands in King and Snohomish counties. He drafted multiple offers, helped us come to purchase agreements with sellers, and with his guidance we were able to close on the perfect location for our start-up business. Having already worked with Geoff in the past we knew how hard he worked (one of the offers he drafted was late at night while he was sitting in the passenger seat driving in a snow storm in Colorado when he was supposed to be on vacation), but he proved it time and time again with the amount of effort he put in to ensure that this commercial real estate purchase went smoothly. Geoff truly is as good as they come and whether we are looking to purchase/sell our home or buy another commercial property, we won't consider using anyone else."

10270,0.20476190476190476,"Crystal was incredible throughout the process of buying a home. I needed my parents as co-signers, and she did a great job of explaining the (insane) market conditions in Seattle to myself (first time home-buyer) and to them (they are seasoned homebuyers in different, less hot, markets).

She has well-honed instincts and seems to know exactly what homes are going to sell for, even when well above list. Not only that, but because she recently remodeled her own home, she was able to offer valuable input as to the costs of certain repairs or upgrades during viewings, which made it easier to evaluate a home's viability for me. She was so available and responsive that sometimes I wondered if she ever slept.

Crystal is whip smart, has a work ethic that puts mine to shame, and is so emotionally intelligent that at times I wondered if she was my realtor or my therapist. It's hard to adult sometimes, but if you choose her as your realtor, you'll be well taken care of!"

After a couple year searching houses, townhouses and condos, I have finally closed on a condo with Geoff. He made the process so smooth, it felt like buying a condo was as easy as buying groceries. All with the proper insurance, coverage and security. I would also add he knows the Seattle area REALLY well and could orient anyone depending on their requirements.

I recently referred a friend of ours to use Mancav Movers. I was surprised to see another customer‚Äôs recent review in which she attempts to discredit this company by saying all the five star reviews are biased because they are required for a discount. This is simply untrue. In order to receive a military discount we were asked to leave a review. Five star reviews are not required, simply an honest review of your experience. After a very long and stressful move out of TX, these guys came in clutch and made our move into our new home easy and stress free. They are a reputable company that we will absolutely use again when we leave here and they don‚Äôt deserve to be misrepresented. They are worth every five star review on here.

Original Review: Mancav movers were amazing to work with! Fast, efficient, professional and accommodating. They unloaded our full 26 foot truck in just a little over two hours. Would definitely hire again."

When I called to apologize and cancel the move Tra (the driver) was so kind, professional, and understanding‚Ä¶.so much so that I decided (just based on how he handled our initial conversation) to call back 5 mins later and have them proceed with the move and just grab what they could. Once they arrived, Tony (the second gentleman), jumped out the truck and immediately introduced himself and shook my hand. I apologized for all of the move day drama and gave them specific details around number of hours I wanted to stay within and which items were priority for the move. Tony & Tra were both attentive, personable, and told me not to worry about a thing. They got right to work‚Ä¶.they were quick, careful, & extremely efficient!!

I had worked with Justin on another project a few years ago, and knew his integrity, diligence and knowledge of the current market would help me get the best outcome.

Justin helped me understand the market conditions and strategize the asking price to maximize the eyes on the listing.  It worked out exactly as planned.  He and the Wagner team were professional, kept me up to date and did everything they promised. Through Justin I learned that you only need to find the one buyer that's the right fit for your property.  They promoted my listing well and I had an offer over asking price within four days of listing!

I appreciate that Justin understood my goals and timeline and helped match those very well to the closing terms.  He coached me through various steps and decisions and made the whole process easy.  I highly recommend him and the entire Wagner team to anyone looking to buy or sell; they know their stuff!"

My first experience was purchasing a condo in Seattle a few years ago, and doing it remotely since I live in Denver. Geoff is extremely knowledge of the Seattle area and market, and so the long distance transaction was smooth and stress free. He also provided me with a great mortgage broker. Finding the right place, working through the negotiations, and closing was a breeze. Earlier this year I engaged Geoff to sell a property. He went above and beyond in helping me (remotely again) with advice and recommendations for prepping and staging, and pricing right for the current market. Again, his knowledge of the Seattle market was impeccable and he helped me navigate the multiple offers. The process was easy, flawless, and the end result beneficial for both me and my buyer.

11075,0.2038888888888889,"I had a good solid cash offer from pronto. My house is by no means a mansion, but i kept it well and over the years did MANY UPGRADES. It was built in 1959, and has lasted thru all the weather florida has had to offer. It is legally a 3 bedroom, with the two back bedrooms connected to each other. After the ‚Äúhome inspection‚Äù they decided they could not buy a house with two bedrooms connected. What a shame they didnt have the vision to see that a hallway could be created to make them separate. Each bedroom has huge windows, and nice size closets, and the two walls separating the bedrooms arent  even load bearing. Well it is their loss of income, literally. If they would have sent a person more versed in this type of thing, the money they said the had already planned to put into the house could have gone toward the making of a hallway, as all the systems are solid, and they wouldnt have needed to invest much at all. So i guess i will just have to create the  hallway myself. Florida will continue to be a hot market, and sitting on half an acre next to an hoa that has deed restrictions also opens a market for me. It wasnt meant to be for me to sell to an investor that is actually from another country. Thank you for your time and Adonai bless you"

We had sold our house in the SF Bay Area with the intent of relocating back to the NW after 45 years of CA living. To say things had changed in those years would have been an understatement, when did Newcastle become a city, or all of these unincorporated areas garner names?! We were not sure when we came up here if we should buy at basically the top of the market, or rent for a period of time to see if the market cooled and prices came down. What this meant was even as we looked around at potential areas to live in, primarily the Eastside but also Pierce County (for housing affordability) we would think about places to rent as well. Jillian had the flexibility and patience to deal with our almost daily change of plans. Through it all she kept us focused on what we had provided as key ‚Äúmust haves‚Äù . We went to several houses Jillian gave us leads on, and she coordinated visits to houses we found and thought were good fits. The house we are in now was a place that she coordinated our viewing of as we were coming back from a visit to another house about an hour away. Thanks to Jillian, our new home met our needs, and has so many more attributes. We are in a house that we can age in (no stairs, single floor), upgraded kitchens and bathrooms, move-in condition,  a large flat backyard with minimal seasonal maintenance requirements but most importantly within 10 minutes of our first grandchild, the reason we were moving in the first place.

I can say with full confidence that Danny has had our best interests at heart. That is the primary thing you want from your realtor. Many well owns realtors are unable to relate to your situation and provide you the guidance you need but it is different with Danny. In our initial meeting with Danny, he listened to our concerns. We explained our point of view and the guidance we need. Since we recently moved to Seattle, he has been super helpful in making us understand the different areas and their potential. Seattle is a difficult market to be buying a house in. Danny has kept us abreast with the changes in the market. He invests time is understanding your needs.

They were supposed to show up at 11am. They didnt show up until 2:15pm. Kind of annoying but it was fine because they were nice. The reason why I'm giving this business a 4 star review is because of the guy who takes care of the phones calls. He just sounded so annoyed whenever I talked to him on the phone. Not sure if it's just his personality but I thought twice before calling because I felt like I was bugging him. It would be nice for them to get someone a little more friendly. I did speak to one lady one of the times I called and she was awesome. Super friendly and patient. Maybe they should just have her answer the calls instead of the other guy.

This time, I got a job in Miami and came to Miami from Seoul. Finding a house in Miami in South Korea was not easy. I've tried Zillow, Realtor, Trulia, etc, but no results. I also emailed the Miami local realtor companies, but they didn't respond. Only Leandro Castro of Miami Realty Solution Group answered my inquiry. Leandro showed me a list of houses that fit my criteria and kept updating the list until I went to Miami. Before we left Korea, we picked a few of houses from the list and Leandro arranged an itinerary for us. We were able to see the houses the very next day we arrived in Miami. On the first day we were able to see 6 houses. Among them, I decided on houses I liked and sent an application. I was not familiar with the process of finding a house in the US, but Leandro kindly taught me about the process. I didn't have any credit, SSN, or proof of tax payment because I didn't live in the US. But with Leandro's help, I applied and got a positive answer from one landlord. The landlord was very nice guy. After an interview with the landlord, I had to undergo background checking at the building office. There were several troubles along the way, but Leandro encouraged me and was on my side. I was really happy when I finally got permission from the office and was freed from expensive hotel fees. When I looked around the house for the last time before I got the key, Leandro was on my side, telling the landlord about the condition of the house and trying to negotiate. Meeting Leandro was the luckiest start of my life in Miami."

They wrapped all our furniture up very well and were careful of the freshly painted corners and door frames in our new house.

Ten‚Ä¶üåü10 starsüåü, hands-down.  I should have gone with Wildcat the first time b/c Darion was so professional and seasoned.  He really knew what he was doing. GREAT leadership!"
10609,0.2013320013320013,"I can‚Äôt say enough about how thorough and efficient the entire team at Richr Realty and Richr Title. My condo was under contract in a week in large part due to the expedient way the listing was entered into MLS with a full range of pictures. I‚Äôve bought and sold many homes and I rank Richr‚Äôs service and professionalism at the top of all the brokers I‚Äôve dealt with. Save yourself a lot of money, you don‚Äôt need to pay a listing agent 3% to put your home in MLS when Richr will do it for free. I strongly urge you to list with Richr, you won‚Äôt regret it!
I closed on the sale of my Condo today (7/9) and used Richr Title to handle the closing. The service I received from Richr Title was as exemplary as the service I received from Richr Realty.
My sister was so impressed with the smoothness of the transaction, they plan on using Richr‚Äôs services when they start looking to buy a new home this fall."
7225,0.2013131313131313,"They are not honest with their prices. Be aware of them quoting promising it will be less than adding even more at the end. Be Aware of this ‚Äòfamily company‚Äô.

Note: They give you a discount if you give them a 5-star review so the other reviews are biased. I told them I will not give them 5 stars and will not take the discount. I originally did not want to give a review out of respect for my friend who referred them but I want to share the truth so customers know if they are looking for an honest mover. This company quoted $2000 and then $3000 after the move and settled on $2600 to move to the building next door. I am a professional that has used movers from Chicago to San Francisco and New York to Miami along with 2 Miami intercity moves and 1 manhattan intercity move.  I have a lot of experience working with movers.

Additional Note: I spoke nothing about the quality of their work only about the transparency of their pricing. If you chose to use them add more to your budget.

~Good luck with your move & choose well ~"

Will definitely call him the next time!"

2019 comment: Iwould give more than 5 star if it was an option! Chris, Rod, Jeremy and the entire team were great and super responsive. We saved Tens of thousands $$$ selling and buying with Trelora. There is no good reason to use anyone else and get ripped off for the same (or worst) service. I wouldn't trust the one star review, Trelora showed us as many homes we asked to see and did all the open houses we needed."
10041,0.200625,"I was a first time home buyer and had just started looking at homes on Zillow for sale. I was interested in one in particular and a realtor met me there and it was Danny and he was as informative and helpful from that day until we found the house we bought. I looked at a lot of homes and I had friends influence me to meet with their realtors and I did meet with them but they were no where near as helpful or as quick to respond as Danny, he is very professional and was genuinely excited for us.

He set us up with any necessary contact including inspector, mortgage broker, insurance broker, security, etc, and each of his recommendations were fantastic and extremely helpful in getting us the quickest, most affordable solution for each step of the process.  Rawlins was speedy, professional, and felt like an old friend. He was very quick to address any potential issue. Buying a home can feel like a long process, but Rawlins made the process fun and feel like a breeze. We would recommend him to ANYONE looking to buy property. He is a one-stop shop for all of your needs in buying a home - as first time home buyers we could not be happier with our decision to work with Rawlins."

11279,0.19996031746031745,"Geoff Hill was a fantastic Realtor. We were moving from Raleigh, NC to the Seattle area and my wife found Geoff online via some reviews she read. It was December 2015 and we were not moving until May 2016, but we wanted to start the process and begin learning about the housing market in the area. I  sent Geoff and email and he responded very quickly. We had a great conversation and Geoff shared his extensive knowledge of the area and we made a plan of where to start looking. There was no pressure at all, he was open to let us drive the process and receive as much or as little information as we wanted. He was very patient with us when we had questions and/or wanted to change the area, size, or price ranges of the search. In February we reached out to Geoff to let him know we were coming into town for a few days to get the lay of the land and that we would like to look at some houses. We made a plan and narrowed our search. In the days prior to our trip we spoke with Geoff about our choices of homes to look at and prioritized them and he made calls to arrange for viewing and did some investigation on the key properties. We arrived in Seattle on Saturday March 5th and had an appointment to meet Geoff on Sunday March 6th. To hear Geoff talk, it was a whirlwind day. We looked at ~20 houses in one day and found that the second house we walked in Mukilteo about 30 min North of Seattle was of great interest and we made an offer. Geoff was fantastic at keeping us leveled and making sure we were realistic in our expectations and amazing in his insight to creating a fair and compelling offer. There was a little back and fourth behind the scenes, but in the end we got the house. Many people in the area we have spoken to (Including Geoff) said it is very rare to come to this area and find both a house you like and make an offer that is accepted a week let alone on one day. Geoff was great. He has a deep knowledge base of the Seattle area and is very creative and savvy with his ideas to make a compelling offer that doesn't get lost in the shuffle. He is extremely attentive and made us feel as though we were his only client. Geoff was on top of the process after the offer acceptance the whole way. He helped us to find an inspector who was great and very quick with his response, as well as a plumber to repair a sump pump we agreed to repair before we left. After we were back in NC, he handled everything without delay. We signed the closing docs remotely and Geoff walked the home for us before closing to ensure nothing had changed with the home since we were last there. We definitely recommend Geoff and we will definitely be utilizing Geoff for our future sales/purchases in the Seattle area."
1343,0.19993315508021392,"Kyle and his crew at Easy Company Moving were incredible to work with and I would recommend them without reservation to anyone. I had a last minute moving cancellation and needed to find a new company within a few days. I called Kyle based on other reviews I saw, and he got back to me with a quote within the day, and I booked shortly thereafter. Communication was excellent. On moving day, he was on time, extremely professional, and efficient. Everything was moved from a packing container across town to a 1BR apartment within a few hours. They were very familiar with city moving/ parking and found a place for the truck without issue. They finished sooner than anticipated and only charged for the time used. These guys seriously saved me from an incredibly stressful situation and I am so grateful! I will absolutely use them again in the future."
9471,0.19978395061728393,"Review is for Long distance moves:

I‚Äôd say the labor aspect of the move was spot on. The packers were in and out really quick and were super polite and very fast.

Communication wise on the corporate end, there‚Äôs too much telephone being played to get answers. You call in to customer service, they have to call operations then operations has to call the driver to see where they are at. Then it moves back down the chain. They did not communicate that there were not going to make the original timeframe on pick up. Ultimately, that wasted one whole day for us moving since we did not get to leave until 8pm. There was also no communication as to when it would arrive, we had confirmation given to us by the driver themselves.

They did try to make it up by taking $400 off the total and expediting the shipment. Overall experience was fast and good but nerve racking because we could never seem to get a  good communication channel even though they said we could call and ask for an estimation of time or arrival."

He helped me find a location very fast in time for starting my new job that fit my requirements and while I wasn't in Miami prior to moving he was extremely reliable by representing me throughout the entire process. I would definitely recommend Jose to anyone else looking to move to the Miami area as he made my overall experience very successful."

Not realizing how quickly each house we looked at would sell, we were directed to Christy through Zillow.  She video conferenced with us to see what we wanted and what our next steps should be. We got our paperwork in order, selected a handful of houses that we were interested in, and they were all off market before we even had a chance to view them! Christy told us this was the market and to keep searching. We eventually selected three houses and Christy was able to get us a viewing ASAP. She worked around our busy work schedule, meeting with us late in the evening and driving to the next county over. Christy was knowledgeable, helpful, friendly and confident. When we eventually look into purchasing our next home, we are going to Christy again. Thank you to Christy and everyone who helped, now comes the fun part of filling our home!"

This removed so much stress from the process and made this an enjoyable experience. Highly highly recommend."

The packing team insured that there was nothing broken and the fact that all of our belongings were loaded into the trucks quickly, efficiently and there were no other clients sharing our trucks reducing any opportunity for problems. If you‚Äôre looking for a moving company local to Dallas or interstate, you really should consider Phoenix Express."
11314,0.19949999999999996,"Geoff was spectacular to work with! We were first-time homebuyers and he took the time to meet with us and go over the entire process without anything binding us. He was always available and responded to emails very quickly. His know-how of the realty business made us feel that we were getting an edge in this crazy market.

Our story: After talking with Geoff about a month before; my wife and I were browsing the MLS and found our house. It went on the market on a Thursday with reviews of offers on Tuesday. We didn't even have our pre-approval letter yet. One of the many lenders that Geoff recommended pulled through for us and got us a letter over the weekend. Pre-inspection went well (Geoff showed up to the inspection even while he was showing another client houses in another market to make sure everything went smoothly). After the inspection passed Geoff took over. He made the process extremely easy and organized. There was a game plan for how we would approach the impending bidding ""war"". Even when we were in the thick of it he still reminded us that there will always be another house and to only go to what we felt comfortable with. Never did he recommend anything outlandish. The only recommendations were ways to gain an edge in the bidding process. Thankfully, our offer was accepted by the seller (I'm sure because Geoff made it very easy for them).

During the closing and purchasing period we were periodically checked on and given updates. He was always available for questions and made the transition from apartment living to home-owning unbelievably stress-free. We are highly recommending Geoff to all friends that are looking for a home."

When we explained that we were in a time crunch from losing so much time the day before, rachelle EXPERTLY zipped us around our preferred area and from just a few questions, understood exactly what we needed. She really knows the properties in Dallas, could refer to the square footage, description, amenities, etc. from memory.

Even when I took a break from searching to get my finances in order Dexter would still contact me to check up on me. He didn‚Äôt make me feel like just another client but more like family who had my best interest at heart.

David's responsiveness and attention to detail made the entire transaction a smooth and stress-free experience!

David's commitment to finding the right tenant was evident in his meticulous screening process. He ensured that the potential tenant was not only financially qualified but also a good fit for the condo. This thorough approach contributed to a successful and trouble-free rental transaction.

My partner and I had an uphill battle moving for work to Seattle during the peak of the market frenzy this May knowing very little about the area. We had a small window to work with on trying to find a home and Geoff delivered. He's very knowledgable about the Seattle area and his recommendations were spot on in helping us get a crash course on the various neighborhoods within our work proximity needs. He was incredibly organized in getting us through 20+ showings in a week and educating us throughout the buying process as first time home buyers. Geoff lived through our highs and lows with us and ultimately, was able to get us into an off market home that perfectly fit our needs due to his persistence, professionalism, and relationships.

My previous experience with an agent on the buy side, basically consisted of them opening the door for me.

Working with Justin Day, and the team at Wagner Real Estate Group, was a wonderful experience, helping us through the entire process with sage advice and proper direction. Our initial meeting with Justin was on 11/13/2019, where he patiently got us up-to-speed with the current real estate environment, and put together a great plan for moving forward. We had very specific needs for our new home, both in type and location, which greatly limited the amount of options available to us. We identified a condo that met our needs and made an offer 7 days after our initial meeting, which was accepted without a counter the next day.  Justin was also handling the listing of our house and made several great suggestions to get it into a condition that would bring top dollar. With new interior paint throughout, a proper amount of decluttering, and strategic staging we listed our house and received 5 offers within a week, accepting one $30K over listing. Justin was able to work with everyone involved in both sales to set aggressive closing dates for both properties, and the entire process went off without a hitch. We couldn't have been happier with the entire experience of working with Justin, and will definitely recommend him to anyone that is looking for real estate advice/assistance."

He was also very responsive and knowledgeable. Because of some issues that came up with some repairs that had to be done before closing, I had to contact Tod a lot.

10338,0.19796620046620048,"After receiving a reply from the owner's attorney via the Attorney General's office, we now know definitively that Jenny Dedrick and Refin were responsible for us losing the house that we HAD A PURCHASE AGREEMENT ON. As per their attorney, we were to have signed paperwork on or prior to 1/4/2023. This paperwork was never presented to us, therefore, it was never signed. Since this paperwork was not signed, the owners cancelled our purchase agreement and moved forward with another buyer. After Jenny Dedrick found out about the other offer, she asked us if we would amend the price of our house so our buyer could be non-contingent. This was on 1/10/2023. It was already too late, but we didn't know that. We agreed to amend the price from $345,000 to $340,000 netting us a loss of $5,000 on the sale of our home that we ALREADY HAD A PURCHASE AGREEMENT ON. The inspection on the purchased property had already been done and paid for. Jenny assured us for over a week that we would not be losing the house, and that we did not need to sign the cancellation agreement. The stress during this time was incredible. We looked for our ""perfect retirement home"" for a year and a half and it looked like we could be losing it. We had ZERO intention of moving until we found the perfect home! After all was said and done, we had sold our home and had no home to move into. We were dividing our belongings into 3 parts. One part that could go into a POD for storage (things that could freeze), one part that had to go into a heated storage unit, and things that we would have to bring with us into our temporary housing while we started a new home search. This was another highly stressful situation; looking for places to store all our things, pricing it, figuring out how to move it and not knowing how long we'd be without a home. We found a home, but it is NOT the home we would have chosen if we did not need a house immediately. Because we already had a deadline to be out of our home, we did not have time to get an inspection on the new home. Redfin reduced some closing fees by $2500. We are still out $3000 (house reduction price and inspection). We asked Redfin to pay us the $3,000 that we lost due to their realtor's error. We also asked ¬†Redfin pay for an inspection on the home that we had to buy so we would have somewhere to live. We are particularly concerned about radon since this home has a well and a basement. ¬†We have gotten NO responses to our requests to get our lost money returned! This was a gross error on her part and we are still in shock that we are in a home that isn't the perfect home for us simply because we needed a place to live. It is unconscionable that we could lose a home and our hard-earned money through absolutely no fault of our own, but due to a professional's error. We are still heartbroken every time we look out a window and see a neighbor instead of the 4 acres of woods and the river that we had originally purchased. User's recommendation: Do NOT use Redfin, especially Jenny Dedrick"

It was a pretty big project, and the team, led by Boris, worked incredibly hard to make sure every single one of our items was wrapped, packed, and labeled carefully. They were extremely attentive to detail and careful with our things. Our estimate was lower than what the actual job cost because we had a lot of extra stuff we didn't account for, but the team managed to finish in the allotted time, and the cost was very fair for the amount of work they did. My only complaint is that the estimator did not question me more to get a more realistic estimate for our amount of items. We would recommend Eco Movers to our friends and family."

Crystal is extremely responsive and communicates articulately. One of my favorite things about Crystal is that she thinks of questions that I did not think of or forgot to ask.

Beyond the work, Crystal is such a wonderful human being. She is super thoughtful - on one of our walk-throughs, she packed coloring books for the young toddlers in our family and they really enjoyed their time with her while the adults talked boring business stuff.

Crystal is such a great fit for us because of her poise and personable demeanor. She provided timely advice but also balanced that with giving us space to voice our opinions and thoughts.

He always underpromises and overdelivers, and his negotiation skills definitely earned us a lot of upper-hands during the purchase. We are in a bit of tricky situation trying to buy a house in Seattle while we are remote and cannot personally go tour the houses, and Geoff make that process seamless by taking professional tour videos and providing equally useful information in the video tours. Between that and online communications, we feel confident that we have the right information and education to make a good decision on the purchase. If you want a stress free experience from first contact to close of the purchase, especially in a fast moving market like Seattle, you definitely need someone like Geoff by you side.

Three years later we moved again and dug up their number. They were again one of the few moving companies that move a piano. They also don't have a minimum 4-hour fee.

To put it simply, we would have found the process too much without Danny guiding us through it all. He brought patience and insight into every home we looked at. As young (mid-late 20s) first time home buyers we needed that insight and tempering of expectations to avoid overbidding or overvaluing what we were putting in bids on. After many weeks of searching and bidding we finally found the home that we're closing on and we couldn't be happier! He's been incredible to work with and we would absolutely recommend that if you're looking for a home purchase that you give Danny a call!

I felt like my experience as a first time homebuyer was fully supported with his guidance during the whole process, so much so that I felt well prepared and moderately confident when making my first and only offer with Remington while Roy was out of town.

At the beginning of the process when I was interviewing real estate agents, Roy had thoughtful responses to my questions that made me trust his instincts for the market and his recognizing of the historic problems within housing that still persist today. Roy's keenness to point out archaic practices helped me feel more grounded in making decisions that aligned with my values around social justice and, in general, moral practices for not bending to the pseudo inflation of market trends.

Roy was always very communicative about his schedule which helped me prepare for open house viewings knowing if he was in town or not. He is also thorough in his responses to questions via email or text. I think our working styles suited each other well, which helped, too.

Overall, a challenging process made easier with Roy's guidance. I am so thankful for Roy's honesty, tact, responsiveness, and thoroughness."

I interviewed several realtors, and Lili stood out from the start.  She was thorough and communicative and had a plan.  The house we wanted had 12 offers, at least one of which was more than ours.  Lili spent time understanding the buyer's needs and how we could meet them even if we weren't the highest offer.  All without any pressure to go over our budget. She and her team at Every Door made it easy.  She is amazing and we highly recommend her!!"

The first time that we were meeting to go see houses happened to be in a heavy heavy downpour with accidents on all major roads. I heard on the news the next day it was the 5th worst traffic conditions have ever been in Seattle. Zach proposed we grab a bite so we went to Il Bistro in Pike St Market and grabbed some food while he explained the home buying process and how I should start getting ready to make a purchase. At the end of eating he took care of the meal!

One thing I really liked about working with Zach was the questions he asked about what I enjoyed and what I was looking for in a home. Zach continued to look into what would be helpful for me and I really appreciated that.

In the end, we closed on a house 21K under asking price that had the giant backyard that my Siberian Husky has been lobbying me for. Zach was very helpful in the negotiations and very responsive.

If you choose to work with Zach you are in excellent hands. Thanks Zach!"
10660,0.19625661375661377,"I have worked with Real Estate Agents in the pass and the experience had left me with no desire to do so.  I had meet with a couple of realtors and was getting the Deja vu feeling knowing I've been here before. I had literally decided to sale my home myself being that I have some background in this field,  until I meet  Geoffrey Fahey.  He came to me in confidence showing me he knew what it took to get the house sold. I truly needed to know that from him, Especially since I am a out of state Client. Geoffrey was able to reassure me he was the realtor for the job, by way of breaking down the art of the business, I could tell he had skills and experience.

Everything went  very smooth (Seamless).  Being a  person with strong Integrity values I believe in treating people the way you want to be treated, and Geoff
delivered above what I expected.

I highly recommend Geoff. Like I stated earlier i have dealt with realtors but I found Geoff to be the right guy for the job.  Anyone who needs to buy, sell or invest in real estate, even if you're out of state Geoff would be trustworthy to oversee it, and again minds was seamless. I was informed on ever turn of the sale and with his recommendations I was able to make over $50,000 dollars more, see that takes skills and experience.

Cash buyers"" and ""investors"" who claim you are saving money by not using Real Estate Agent but,  in reality, they offer a lot less then  flip your house and get all the money you left on the table.

Working with a good realtor like Geoffrey I could see I was part of a strong team. Thank you Geoffrey so much for handling my sale with Professional expertise, skillful knowledge and experience."

8266,0.19448757763975155,"I normally don‚Äôt write reviews on sites, but felt I had to share about our amazing experience working with Crystal. We just completed the purchase of our 2nd home in Seattle, and Crystal was a FANTASTIC realtor for us throughout the process.

Market Knowledge - We knew nothing about the West Seattle market, and her level of insight and knowledge was critical in us honing in on specific neighborhoods and houses. When she planned our viewings with her, she guided us through the pros and cons of the area, and also took the opinions we shared to refine her searches, and also advise us ahead of time on what we should consider for houses we‚Äôd wanted to view.

Responsiveness/Helpful - buying a house might be one of the most stressful experiences we‚Äôve had (both in general, and as a married couple). Crystal was so incredibly responsive, and that‚Äôs so important in helping to ease the stress. Anytime we reached out, we literally heard back in a matter of minutes, probably 30 min max. I can‚Äôt explain how impactful that is for the buyers... Also, my hubby and I have very different styles when it comes to homes, and it led to a lot of stress and conflict between us. Crystal navigated those moments like a pro, and was able to use actual data and her knowledge to help us compromise and adjust our expectations to align. Our ‚Äúmust haves‚Äù were SO different at first, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd have our house now if Crystal hadn‚Äôt guided us through that.

Offer Process - The other major contribution was that throughout the offer process, she had a strategy and the insights needed to make the right offer. She was thorough and transparent when advising us, and helped us adjust when we were being unrealistic. She also managed negotiation with the sellers really well, and we ended up getting the house below asking and below appraisal!

If you‚Äôre buying a home in Seattle, Crystal should be the 1st person you call :)"
11181,0.19445312500000003,"Geoff demonstrates the highest level of integrity and professionalism and I would highly recommend him to all my friends, colleagues and enlist him again on my next home purchase. I initially started my search with a Redfin agent; however, it was a disappointing and discouraging experience. I switched gears and decided that a traditional real estate agent would best suite my needs, as I moved from LA to Seattle. I needed a seasoned realtor who was willing to view properties with me to really have a solid understanding of what I was looking for and what I wasn‚Äôt looking for. I reached out to Geoff requesting a 30 minute call because I wanted to inquire about his background and his sentiment on this competitive market and he nailed it on all the responses. Geoff and Kelly were always willing and promptly able to accommodate my late evening tour schedule. He ultimately provides you all the facts to make an informed decision about your home purchase. I never once felt pressured to put in an offer; if anything, Geoff talked me out of a few mediocre homes. The overwhelming experience can impair your judgment causing you to make some impulsive and emotional decisions, which prevented me from having buyer‚Äôs remorse (it‚Äôs real). I lucked out; patience, a little luck, and a great realtor/negotiator, I got the home. Geoff and Kelly both went above and beyond the day and leading up to my closing, something they didn‚Äôt have to do, but their willingness overwhelmed me and I‚Äôm eternally grateful. Geoff has a no-nonsense/blunt approach and always has your best interests in mind. He was incredibly responsive and even spent over an hour on the phone going page by page explaining to me what I was signing. Overall, it was a daunting experience; however, I‚Äôm fortunate I had Geoff and Kelly on my side. If only there were more genuine and honest realtors, like Geoff."

4312,0.19222976190476193,First I have to say by far the best movers that we have ever used!!!! And we have moved quite a few times. From the first call asking about there services to the end taking payment was amazing! Very professional and helpful. The manager even came out while they where loading up to check on the move and make sure everything was going well. Which it was. The manager even helped load up a few things in his AB Moving dress shirt. Tyler and the other 2 guys that did our move did excellent! Everything made it without damages. They went beyond what any other movers did for us. They wrapped up big stuff which was a plus for us! We had to do 2 trips but we had a 4 bedroom 2700 sq ft home and a lot of stuff. On the way back to do the 2nd trip we remembered that we forgot to tell them about a large closet that we had full of packed boxes. When we told them about it they said no problem. They were very understanding and we heard no complaining. Pricing was average to less than average! Very reasonable! If we move again we will for sure go back to AB Moving!! Thanks again guys for a job well done!!!

They provided a ton of support with the offer process on what was reasonable to offer. During closing, their team was a well oiled machine with setting clear timelines and pressing us when they needed to get specific documents and signatures done.

He was not just looking to get me to buy a place, but considered the potential return-on-investment for the properties. Following Doron's advice, I was able to purchase a property for less than what I was willing to pay. I hope to work with Doron and his team again in the future and recommend that you get in touch!"

We hired Wildcat movers to get us out of that apartment and The 4 Man Crew consisting of -Sean, Tyrone, Taylor & Gill - came in as our Angels and packed up three years of our lives and moved us to safety! They were extremely swift, professional and amazingly good spirited bunch of guys. They made it easy and hassle free for us! A much needed change from the entire ordeal we had already gone through and continued to go through with a unsupportive leasing office and the destruction friendly demolishing crew.

Was told all was going well--they requested a 10 day extension of the closing date which I agreed to claiming they had too much business at the time.

2322,0.19065656565656566,"I was a first time homebuyer with almost no knowledge of the homebuying process, but Krystina Thompson at Every Door was very knowledgeable, and always available to answer questions. At the beginning she helped me sift through a whole bunch of properties, filtering out the ones I would have gone for, but she could tell when something was off- either a scam, something wrong with the house, etc. After we saw a few houses, I was able to narrow it down to one house. Because it was a fixer-upper, she recommended I go with a pre-inspection to speed up the process, and a bunch of other ways of sweetening the deal for the seller. Krystina was able to write and send in an offer super, super fast- eventually the seller came back with a counteroffer, which I accepted. So I was able to close on the first house we put in an offer on, even though it is so hard for millenials and younger folks to buy a house these days. Throughout the whole process it felt great to have someone representing my interests that I felt was the best at what they do."

From getting a quote to finish moving, Mark (Owner) and the team was beyond my expectation. Very clear quote and no hidden fee. Without seeing my old home, Mark was able to give me brief idea how long it could take - he said 3-4 hours. I was highly doubtful because I have lots of stuff.

The day of moving, 4 guys came - the head of team arrived about 5 mins before and look around to get estimate and told me it wouldn't take more than 4 hours. Still I was thinking it will take more than 6 hours because packing wasn't completed. I injured my back that I had to put cloths in trash bags which made things more harder for guys. Also my new place, we couldn't reserve service elevator that it was taking longer.

These 3 guys worked hard even no one could imagine. I offered drinks and little break time, but they kept going that I thought they had energizer battery in them :)

Everything was moved within 4 hours like Mark and head of the team said and nothing was damaged.

I was telling my mom those guys were God sent.

Thank you Mark and the team. You are the best!!!"

4488,0.19008394044979413,"We had a FANTASTIC experience with The Every Door Team! Our agent's name is ADAM TREAT and let me tell you that he is by far an amazing person. What makes him an amazing person? Not only does he look at the present for what is best for the client, but he also makes consideration for what is the best for the client's future. Adam used his expertise and make throughout judgments based on whether the Condo is best for the customer in short term and including the long term. In terms of finance, Adam used every variable to speculate that in long term for that specific area the HOA fee would not immediately skyrocket and he is determined that the condo would continue to value high by year in the case when we sell in the future. Another factor why you should choose Adam as your agent is because he is knowledgeable in regards to how the interior house is in good condition or not. We tour one different condo and Adam was able to point out specific details on the interior condo which was poorly structured and painted. Thanks to Adam we avoided that one condo which was poorly designed and without him we would likely have missed these small detail and made a poor decision. Lastly why you should choose The Every Door Team and Adam Treat as your agent is because he gave us a list of reference to all other local company that deals with repairs in the future when something happens. He taught what to do and who to call for each thing if and only when something needs to be repaired in the future. When we first met Adam and he says his passion was to help people find the right house and make them happy, he did live up to what he said and he is a cool person. This was a 10/10 fantastic experience and we love our new place thanks to Adam and The Every Door Team! - Sky"
8714,0.1900314529220779,"The words that immediately come to mind when I think about my experience working with Ron Gates of Every Door Real Estate are ‚ÄúAbove and Beyond.‚Äù I got so much more than a realtor working with Ron. Here are just a few of the key roles he played in my home-buying journey:

1. Teacher ‚Äì I am a lifelong renter with no experience in purchasing or maintaining a house. Ron walked me through every step of the home buying process, answering all of my questions along the way, spending hours communicating with me via Zoom, phone, text, and in person. He is such a fantastic resource! On top of being very knowledgeable about real estate, Ron is also quite a skilled tradesperson with a wealth of knowledge about carpentry and general home repair and maintenance. When we viewed potential homes, he showed me what to look for (stuff like the condition of the roof, rain gutters and downspouts; foundation issues including cracks and signs of uneven settling; signs of moisture/wood rot; the condition of the plumbing fixtures, faucets, and water heater; even the condition of other homes in the neighborhood!). Once I decided on a home, he walked me through putting together a reasonable but competitive offer, obtaining a quality inspection, and the entire closing process. When I closed on the home, Ron brought over bags of tools/supplies as a housewarming gift to help me get started out as a new homeowner. He even taught me how to patch and paint holes/defects in my walls, helped me fix my garage door opener, and offered to teach me how to stain my fence! I have learned so much though this home buying journey with Ron!

2. Intermediary ‚Äì Ron connected me with so many invaluable resources to help me along my home buying journey. These contacts included my superb and knowledgeable mortgage broker (shout out to Caroline Jaffe of Cross Country Mortgage), top notch home inspectors (shout out to Pillar to Post Home Inspectors), and he even connected me with his own personal handyman (shout out to Dan the Handyman!). I had an excellent experience with all of these resources and look forward to using them in the future.

3. Confidant ‚Äì During this process, Ron consistently showed me that he is someone I can trust. He never came across as pushy or like a salesperson. He regularly checked in with how I was feeling and was very transparent at each step of the home buying process. He made sure that I did not sign off on anything without knowing what I was doing, and what my rights and obligations were. This made a very overwhelming process much less stressful.

4. Counselor ‚Äì Like I said above, this was my first home purchase. And like many times in recent years, this was a crazy time to buy, with mortgage rates rising daily, limited inventory, stiff competition, etc. This process can be incredibly overwhelming! Like most folks, I had been saving for years to make this purchase and was absolutely terrified of sinking my life savings into a money pit. There were times when I was actively looking for a way to opt out of the whole home-buying process because I did not want to lose the security of my little nest egg of savings. During all of this, Ron was always there to listen to my concerns and provide solid advice. He never pushed me in one way or the other. I never felt rushed or pressured by Ron. I always felt that his greatest motive was my overall satisfaction with my home purchase.

5. Cheerleader ‚Äì Ron seemed genuinely excited to share this home-buying journey with me, and his positive energy really helped balance out some of my apprehension. He helped me to remember that although this process can be scary and overwhelming, it can also be exciting and fun!

6. Go-getter - Ron gets things done! Once my mind was made on a home, he wasted no time in getting my offer on the table and accepted, then he created a detailed timeline to make sure everything progressed smoothly - which included everything from obtaining an inspection to transferring utilities over to my name."

5749,0.18958501268846098,"There is always something that I dread, it's moving. I was never really a fan. I hated the process of packing and actually moving myself to the new place - renting the truck, loading it, and unloading. However, in the last couple of moves I did, I had used some kind of moving service to help me. And by far, Pure Moving exceeded my expectations. For some reason, I chose an early morning time, but Oskar, Isco, and Artem took that in stride and came to my place ready. I knew our move won't be easy. The team had to deal with a small space, with a huge number of boxes of books, and the weather was not so friendly. But they moved efficiently and quickly. I watched them painstakingly wrap all our furniture, and even double checked with me if something not boxed was going to the new place or not. The team was very attentive, friendly, and very thorough the entire time. Honestly, one of the best experiences I had.

This is a family owned and run business who take obvious pride in what they do and the men they hire are polite, hardworking, careful and diligent. It wasn‚Äôt a simple move as we needed to also stop at my storage unit to drop off and pick up several large pieces of furniture. They were able to make the exchange even though the original movers complained throughout the process. Alex and his team were simply  amazing.  I‚Äôve been in the interior design business for years and my ‚Äúthings‚Äù are both unique and in many cases fragile. Nothing was damaged in anyway (unlike first move).

11437,0.18832288401253922,"My husband and I worked with Geoff in an extremely difficult real estate market as first time homebuyers. The challenges were numerous. Homes escalating 25% above asking, many multiple offer situations, low inventory etc. At times it was completely demoralizing. Let me just say, we couldn't have survived without Geoff.

To start, he was unbelievably supportive in educating my husband and I in the complexities of the home buying process. This took a ton of work on his end but helped us feel equipped to make sound decisions at every step of the way.

Geoff understands the local market more than anybody. We were new to the area so this helped us immensely and we felt like all of our questions were answered thoroughly. He's also been in this field so long that he has an extensive network of people he can refer you to if something is outside of his purview. From loan agents, to home inspectors, and even arborists.

At the end of the process we were able to successfully purchase a home. The situation we found ourselves in was favorable due to some background work that Geoff did. Finding yourself in a favorable situation in this market feels unheard of. Without Geoff, we might still be looking.

I didn't grasp just how important the agent choice is in the home buying process until we were in the thick of it. There were so many ways he brought massive value to our search with his knowledge and expertise. If you want to work with an agent who you can trust, who fully has your back, and who knows everything, you'll want to pick Geoff. I can confidently say that he genuinely wants the best outcome for his clients whether it benefits him or not."

But last year we used WaLaw Realty to help purchase our first home. We already owned a home, but didn't have the experience of going through the process of a new home purchase. In addition we were going to purchase a new construction. Before hearing about WaLaw Realty (from friends), we had worked with an agent who had worked with some of our family members. Later we realized it was a poor fit and decided to contact WaLaw.

We first emailed Marc and later followed up with some phone calls. We immediately felt at ease as if we could trust him before we had even met in person. We felt like he allowed us to voice our thoughts and concerns and genuinely listened to what we had to say. After deciding that we would like to work with Marc, we had our first meeting. It was like a breath of fresh air as we were able to be ourselves and not feel pushed or pulled in any particular direction.

As we got closer to making important decisions, Marc really helped both of us by giving us things to think about as well as providing feedback. We are both analytical people who sometimes spend too much time making a decision. But Marc was patient and understanding, and had the right balance of knowing how much space to give us, as well as when to gently nudge us.

In the end we made our first new home purchase and are extremely pleased with our home. Marc helped give us a positive experience, and was always there answering any questions about the process along the way. While we tried to understand all the wording of the sales agreement ourselves, Marc was diligent in reading everything in detail and going through the sales agreement with a fine tooth comb. He handled the sometimes annoying law lingo that can be a struggle to sort through and acted as our translator ;).  He was both professional and personable, and it definitely felt like we were just working with an old - time, not age! ;) -  friend of ours.

We are more than pleased with our experience with WaLaw Realty and would highly recommend their services to anyone looking to sell or purchase a home.

p.s. We didn't have the pleasure of meeting Marc's partner Craig, but we did get to meet their office manager Claire, who is also a very sweet and kind person to work with. =)"

Unfortunately for Christian, as an attorney, I was extremely picky and was also working within a budget. Nevertheless he drove me around and showed me approximately 10 apartments. He knew all the pros and cons of each apartment and he was not hesitant to be candid with his opinions on each place. Unlike others in his profession, Christian was less concerned about getting me to sign a lease immediately, and more concerned about finding a place for me that he knew I would like and feel comfortable with. After our initial search, I was still unable to make a decision. As weeks passed Christian updated me on price changes and other important factors to consider as the market fluctuated. I thought I had made my decision and right before I was going to sign a lease on one place Christian called me and wanted me to check out another place that had just been built. He thought I would really like it - he was right. He got me this great place at a very good price. I've currently been living in the new apartment complex he found for me for about 4 months now and I love it. Christian did a great job and I am very happy with their service.

11365,0.1856302781917536,"In early 2014, on the advice of a close friend who has both bought and sold real estate with him, I reached out to Geoff to investigate my options for buying my first home. I knew very little about the process and hadn‚Äôt even determined exactly where I wanted to buy or how much I wanted to spend.

Over the following 10 months, Geoff educated me about the home-buying process, referred me to an awesome mortgage broker for loan pre-approval, and sent me the newest property listings that fit the criteria I wanted in a home.

By late 2014, with my loan pre-approval letter in hand, I was ready to begin touring properties to find the perfect one. Whenever I wanted to tour a new listing, Geoff (or his showing assistant, Colleen) was available to get me in to see the house. Nights, weekends, even on extremely short notice, Geoff facilitated me being able to tour the houses I wanted to see on MY schedule, at MY convenience.

As most people know, the market in the Seattle area has been extremely competitive recently. I knew there was a good chance that I might be competing against other buyers for the same house. Sure enough, when we found a house I really liked, there was a deadline for offers. We had a long conversation about all the different ways to craft an offer that would appeal to the sellers. I had no idea that there are so many ways to make an offer desirable to the seller that DOESN‚ÄôT require offering more money. Geoff didn‚Äôt pressure me to offer more than I was comfortable offering and when he submitted my offer, I felt completely at ease, win or lose. . .

Unfortunately, we were one of 15 offers and we didn‚Äôt get the house. But because Geoff had prepared me so well, I didn‚Äôt get frustrated nor discouraged. I was ready to get ‚Äúback on the horse‚Äù and find ‚Äúmy home!‚Äù

A few months later along came the pad but the seller was asking for more than I wanted to spend. It‚Äôs deadline had passed and he received no offers. I told Geoff that I would be happy to buy if a bit less than the seller was asking. So we submitted an offer that was significantly lower. The seller countered us aggressively, insisting on a price that was almost as high as the original. Over the next 4 days came a back and forth ‚Äúteeter.‚Äù At many points I assumed our offer was dead, but Geoff stayed aggressive, insisting there was a way to get the house for the price I wanted. We finally managed to reach a mutual acceptance ‚Äútauter‚Äù for $25,000 less than the asking price! I don‚Äôt think this would‚Äôve been possible without Geoff‚Äôs extraordinary negotiation skills.

Anyone who thinks real estate agents don‚Äôt deserve the money they make hasn‚Äôt met Geoff Hill. Although he‚Äôs the only agent I‚Äôve ever worked with, most likely will stay just that. I could not be happier with my first home buying experience and I have him to thank!"

The home buying process went smoothly, and Rob's team continued to communicate important deadlines to us.

After purchasing our home, Rob and his team continued to go above and beyond in helping us identify contractors for some kitchen renovations, and coordinating with them to access the property as we move across states. We couldn't have asked for a better experience and highly recommend Rob, Bobby, and the Bushwick team!"

The referral did not disappoint and they by far exceed all expectations in a move. From initial call and preparation, the company was extremely kind, responsive, and professional.

Felix and Luis were two from the team that greeted us on moving day. The two were highly knowledgeable and provided clear, accurate communication on the moving logistics and timeline of the day. Our family was moving from a multi-level complex, upper level with only stair access, Felix and Luis were true magicians in getting our large valuables (8-person solid wood dining table, sectional, etc) wrapped, packed, and set up in our home without any issues.

Hoping this review helps pass the good word along to others during their moving journeys.  I highly recommend this company and was so impressed with how easy they made everything. We cannot thank Eco Movers enough for the above and beyond work and positive experience during our big move!"

When my Grandmother passed and we needed to hire movers to transport her 150 year old pump organ and other large furniture items to multiple different family households, I immediately emailed Jeff because I knew Phoenix could be trusted to do the job with care. They brought plenty of moving blankets for all of the furniture items, cautiously dismantled them, wrapped them carefully, and delivered everything without losing so much as a screw and without a scratch. Even my fussy Aunt and Uncle, who thought we should just rent a U-Haul, had to admit this was a great experience and worth every penny.

From the very beginning, Joe was very knowledgeable, accommodating and professional. He helped me understand the needs of my move, answered all my questions even when it came to storage on the other end, and was so flexible with all the changes due to the snow storm. One thing I really value is companies that treat their employees right and I was happy to see they would not risk their employees‚Äô safety to stay on schedule during the freezing storm.

The moving team was made up of Luis P, Luis L. and Felix. They were fantastic! Luis L. Was the crew lead and clearly took a lot of pride in his work- he has former experience delivering with high-end furniture stores in Dallas. They were super careful with all of my belongings and I was amazed by how they loaded everything into the moving truck. We even passed them on the highway and we were so happy to see how carefully they were driving - we left a good while after them and know they didn‚Äôt expect to see us.

Price-wise, they were very fair. I received quotes from other companies and this was the most reasonable and clear quote I received. Other quotes were confusing, had additional add-ons in terms of possible fees, and I was unsure what I would pay in the end. This was a long distance move from Dallas to San Antonio and I really value that I understood exactly what I was getting into. I really wish I could hire this team in San Antonio for my next move!"
9614,0.1842686788520122,"I recently bought a large house in Miami with Nathali Delgado. As a airline pilot I was not living in Miami and almost never in town during the process. I specifically sought her out because of her vast personal investing experience. I am an investor and wanted somebody who would see things the way I do. I had so many unforeseen challenges buying this house. Down payment, DTI, co-signing, rising interest rates, contractors falling through, being stuck in foreign counties with no cell service or internet, and major home repairs to name a few. Nathali knew what to do at every step of the way and handled every obstacle with ease whether I was available to even take phone calls or not. She provided invaluable insight when buying the home, choosing a location, layout and renovation tips with the GC. She also positively negotiated with the sellers and selling agent throughout the entire process. I could have easily lost the deal had I not had a realtor with experience and exquisite negotiating skills. Now I am extremely happy with my purchase.  I will likely be using her for all of my home purchases and investments moving forward and also highly recommend her as I already have to my personal friends."

4408,0.18345454545454548,"We were lucky to work with Erik Enright to sell our Magnolia Condo in March of 2021.

After months of trying to decide whether or not to sell our condo (during the pandemic), We met with Erik to discuss the market. He gave a very thorough and honest breakdown of what it would take to sell it quickly, and at top dollar.  This was our first time selling, so we naturally had a lot of questions -- Erik's responses were quick and clear. Nothing was too small or too silly.

After listing, we found out some new information from our HOA which Erik dove into the HOA bylaws to clarify for us exactly how this affected us. It wasn't to our advantage, but that didn't stop Erik from going after the sale.

In the end, he negotiated a higher price and squeezed out a bit more even when we should have just been taking the offer.

I'd recommend Erik to anyone. His work ethic is insane. He is constantly in communication with his clients, the other agents, and any necessary resources. He is a top-notch negotiator (to negotiate from behind like he did for us takes skills). He is current on market trends. He gives honest and straightforward answers.

If you want to buy in this market OR get the best price for your listing, give him a call."

I found my self being told ""no"" more often by my real-estate agent than by the seller. I repeatedly had to push them to negotiate on my behalf. This became more frustrating as each time we got exactly what we wanted from the seller. The search process was okay and I was quite satisfied with this part of the service. As soon as we were under contract, things started to fall apart. We were given incorrect information several times throughout and only found the correct answers by going to others I knew in real-estate. Johnnie was very informed and everytime I dealt with her I definitely felt more supported; however, those interactions were few and far between. If I could do it again, we would have gone with someone else. At the end of the day, our real-estate agent was not ready to be on her own and should've had more support from her team."

We looked at a wide range of houses, and Geoff was the ideal guide. He brought a huge depth of knowledge and insight to help us make the best decision for us both personally and financially.

We only made one offer. Geoff provided a strategy, and allowed us to make the final decisions. Five offers were made on the house, and we won by a very narrow margin. We were in our new home by Christmas, and we couldn‚Äôt be happier.

She helped us see what we needed to improve on Mom's house, and what was unnecessary to upgrade for a sale. It was a brilliant move, the house sold almost immediately. She had someone video the house inside and outside with a drone. I still have copies of her ad. It was amazing.

During the collaboration, their Seattle buy team's quick response, efficiency and carefulness amazed us, compared with the other agents we cooperated before.
Compared with normal buy agent, we were working with a whole buy team, which means several members cover the whole process, like schedule open house, prepare the offer, following up the listing agent, and each team member knew well about your condition and progress, which is more efficient.

10316,0.1812820512820513,"WaLaw helped us purchase a townhome in Capitol Hill.

Having all of the documents reviewed by an attorney gave us a considerable amount of peace of mind. Until working with a real estate attorney, I didn't realize how many real estate agents and builders give you legally questionable information during the home purchase process.

During the due diligence process of a townhouse that we were interested in purchasing, we found a legal issue with their covenants, conditions, and restrictions. We notified the owner/seller of the problem and decided not to move forward with this property. The current owners of the townhome complex had to hire a real estate attorney and started fixing the issue with the CC&R. It's so much nicer to be able to avoid this kind of legal mess before you are in it. We ended up buying another townhome.

WaLaw charges a fixed amount of fees, which gives you access to an attorney and agent. Honestly, they have a very strong value proposition.

The only downside is that they have more of fixed working hours. If you are the kind of person who wants to talk to your agent at 2 am on weekends, it may not work out. This wasn't an issue for us, though. I'll definitely use WaLaw again if I sell or buy a house in the Seattle area in the future."

10686,0.1809821428571428,"If you are interested in selling your house in the Seattle area and you think a 6% comission for a half million dollar house (plus 2% excise tax) is too much off the top, than Trelora should be your number 1 choice. I sold my house with Trelora after 5 days on market for over list price and walked away with $10k more in my pocket than other agents.

Trelora is a team operated real estate agency.  Similar to Redfin, but beat them on price.   Every step of the way I was treated with respect, received rapid responses, and was kept well informed of the process.  One thing I really liked was their website stated what they were doing in the background. Brock came in and went through a detailed comparative market analysis and gave us tips on staging.  Lanny came by and took some excellent photos.  I don't understand looking at other listings why their pictures look like they were taken with a flip phone.  Last, Rod was my main POC and excellent.  I really could not have asked for a better experience for selling my first house.

You may want to know a few things up front.  You will have to work a bit on your end. I suspect this is pretty similar for other agents, but for example a direct comparative house went pending for 25k over what we originally discussed.  If I didn't say something and monitor it, maybe we wouldn't have gotten as much.  Everything is digital, you get an assigned text number and you may not meet the entire team.  It feels kind of weird not meeting Rod who did so much for my house and family.  Last, Trelora advertises being able to request a lower buyer agent.  Unfortunately, this area appears to be a racket and the house wasnt shown by other agents despite having a large digital traffic.  The reason likely is the comission. I did have to sell with a full 3 percent to the buyer agent. At the end I got exactly what I wanted.

Despite these things, Trelora is worth every penny and then some.*****"

They carefully wrapped and loaded all of my items and treated them all with care. They finished wrapping and loading the truck in about two hours. We headed to my new apt which was upstairs, but they tackled it like champs. It only took them a little under an hour to unload the truck, bring everything up one flight of stairs, and set everything back up.

Including the drive time, it took 4 hours and 15 minutes to complete the job.

4166,0.18065870910698487,"Tod's attention to detail is exceptional.  DFWCityhomes provides full service real estate services at a fraction of the cost.  At first, I was skeptical the same level of service would be provided at a flat fee.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  By leveraging technology to provide a higher level of service and simply working harder for the customer's interests, DFWCityhomes provides an experience that rivals or exceeds full (6%) commission real estate sales.

Although I was extremely impressed with the business model overall, I was most impressed with Tod's professional photographs of my home.  I believe his photographs directly contributed to the quick sell (contract in less than three weeks with multiple offers) of my home.  In the past, I've worked with full commission agencies who hired ""professional"" photographers and ultimately ended up using my own photographs because their photographs were not very good.  Tod's photographs are a game-changer."
4311,0.18056321410829607,"Our experience was beyond excellent! We cannot even express how awesome our experience was since the beginning!

My husband and me were moving from 1 bedroom apartment in Seattle to a 3 bedroom apartment in Bothell. We thought it was going to be easy, but our new apartment it's in a 3rd floor with high ceilings and no stairs. Because of the pandemic we tried to do the moving by ourselves but after two weeks working on it we ended up so tired and overwhelmed that we had to accept we needed help. I even got sick from the moving.

We contacted like 5 movers that google suggested before we contacted EcoMovers and none of them were flexible, nor available or even that interested. We were getting so close to our moving out date and so tired of the obstacles that we were getting into a point where we were just going to donate our whole belongings. We just wanted to move!

I saw the EcoMovers truck in our apartment complex doing a moving at 8 am and by 11:30 am they were gone! So I was like, ""you know what I am going to check them!"" The reviews online were great, but usually we are the people that even with good reviews we will be still having horrible experiences.

Well, we send a quote request online on a Sunday afternoon for a moving for Wednesday expecting them to call maybe by Monday or Tuesday at least but I was wrong. Kayla called us 10 minutes later! She was so flexible and amicable we were shocked. They didn't had Wednesday available but they did have Tuesday which was even better for us! Kayla explained everything easily and the whole process was just so smooth. I went from freaking out to ""okay we can do this.""

We put everything we could in 15 large boxes. We named and marked every box to make it easier for them to see what was fragile and what's not. Our boxes were pretty heavy, we had like 200 books, ceramics, electronics and kitchen stuff. Out priority was the bed, the dresser, the sofa, a chaise and 4 other furniture items. So we were conscious that the boxes were heavy, so my husband told them that they could leave the boxes in the garage. They were so fast AND careful with our furniture plus the 15 boxes, it was impressive! They treated our items with such care. No dents on the surroundings, not even noise moving stuff. Nothing was broken either. It was like they were floating or something! In one hour the apartment was clean.

When they came to the new apartment we thought they were going to leave the boxes in the garage after seeing the stairs from hell that we moved into. But no! They pick up every each one of our furniture and each one of the boxes and leave it into our new apartment! What?? When my husband called me to inform that they were able to put everything in the apartment I couldn't believe it! My first thought was ""They are saints!"". Both of our movers were so respectful, humble, courteous, diligent, professional, and understanding! Like wow.

Also, our moving was $100 below our agreed price, which was already such a great price! And per the other moving companies quotes we received, EcoMovers was the best deal by far, plus great service and care?? I am still trying to get over this! After the moving they reach out to us to check on the experience and the feedback. It was so pleasing! I wish them the best in their business for sure! Definitely I will be contacting them in the future! If you are in doubt, don't be!! These are your guys!"

9025,0.18051587301587302,"I sold my office furniture and needed it to be moved downstairs and wanted a professional moving company to do the job. After much research I chose Mancav Movers. The owner Manny was able to schedule it for a Sunday morning. Miguel and Jose arrived right on time and proceeded to get to work. They worked well together and were very mindful of my many requests to be careful of the walls, lighting, etc! They stayed calm even when we had to break down the desk some to get it out the office door. All furniture was wrapped and protected well. I would definitely recommend Mancav Moving and will use them on my upcoming relocation move as well."
9330,0.18049090909090906,"I felt I should leave a Google review because that's how I discovered Pure Moving in Miami and because the job was so WELL DONE! From the initial phone call with Austin to all email correspondence, their sales team/customer service staff (mostly Austin with sprinkles of Nick) were incredibly responsive, helpful, and patient. On move day, Roman texted me an update on their arrival time. Then he, Tim, and Vlad arrived with professional demeanors and worked efficiently as well as strategically. If you‚Äôre looking for movers to do what they say they‚Äôre going to do, then look no further. Absolutely recommend!

Update: First, I am not a bot, and I was not compensated for writing this review. I am writing this solely to assist anyone who may be looking for a trustworthy and fair moving company in the Miami area. We had such a positive experience with Pure Moving Company Miami on our first move, that we requested they assist us with our next move out of storage into our apartment on January 2, 2024. I worked out the move-in details with my building and then logistics with Christian and Tad at Pure Moving Miami a few days before the move because communication is key! I completed the online reservation form Pure Moving instructed to utilize to formally get on their schedule. On the day of the move, Roman and Alex texted their estimated arrival time. We briefly discussed specifics, and everything progressed as planned. The entire team at Pure Moving Miami is stellar. I will highly recommend them to all my friends and will contact them again on our next move! Thank you!"
8570,0.18046875000000004,"My husband and I have used Exodus exclusively since moving to Dallas about four years ago. I stumbled upon them while doing a search for affordable movers and truly found a gem.

Exodus has moved me into two 5000+ square-foot homes, townhomes, rentals, storage units and out again. I have never had one piece of furniture scratched or one wall damaged. Everything is wrapped and secured and carefully transported in and out. My things are important to me and I would not trust them to any other company.

They pack boxes, disassemble AND reassemble furniture, install appliances, hang paintings, curtain rods. They literally  do everything! I have not found another company that offers a lower price per hour for the number of men they send and the quality of work they do.

They show up on time. They never rush. Every worker I have encountered has been professional. I have never had an issue with communication. The front office has always been responsive. They tell me when they are coming, when they need to leave and why. They confirm the appointment and are very flexible with my schedule.

They are a locally-owned company that does an amazing job and definitely worth a try if you are looking for a dependable and affordable moving company."

I considered listing it the traditional way but dreaded the months of showings and negotiations, and especially in this climate. That's when I heard about Priority Home Buyers. I was hesitant, but their straightforward approach was refreshing. They gave me a fair cash offer, handled the paperwork, and allowed me to close a chapter without added stress. Highly recommend if you're looking to sell without the usual hassle."

The crew (Hugo, Chris, Alexis, and Israel) did an excellent job of packing the truck - loading and unloading. No wasted time!

No damages to my belongings or to my new home.  They were on time and very efficient. I would definitely recommend them.

11861,0.18000000000000002,"My wife and I worked with Michael to find a house hack in the Seattle area. Michael was very knowledgeable about every step in the process. For example, he helped us identify properties that would provide solid returns and identified ways that we could add value. Once we identified potential homes, Michael was also great because he helped us estimate renovation costs. So far, his estimates have been spot on. Finally, Michael was great in the negotiation phase. On the house we ended up purchasing, Michael took the time to write a fantastic offer letter that introduced our family and plans for the home to the seller. We heard back from the seller that this extra touch is partially why they accepted our offer. I'd recommend Michael to anyone interested looking for a home in the Seattle area (though I know he's knowledgeable of the Tacoma area as well).

With so much discouragement in the market outside of our control it was nice that there was one positive consistent helping me along the way. I even took a break for a year after a few failed offers and he never made me feel like I had wasted his time, and was right there for me when I was ready to start back up.

The home I ended up with was one that Danny had personally recommended to me, less than 24 hours after that I had an accepted offer. I wouldn't have my home if it wasn't for his alertness and speed in putting together an offer for me."

There was the critical renovations he recommended for improving the sale value of the home while keeping cost and return on investment in mind. Also the strategy around the pricing of the property lead us to a sale that was well over the list price and exceeded my expectations.

He was always responsive. Even at hours for which I didn't expect a reply until the next day, an email would show up in my inbox in 15 min. He was straight forward with his evaluation of the property and wasn't afraid to say where things needed work or facts that might have been disappointing but were also important to acknowledge.

He recommended great people to work with (home inspector, stager, photographer). And after the renovations were finished I basically had no worries from staging, photography, listing, etc right through to closing."

I used them for my move two weeks ago and the movers were very friendly but it took them an hour alone to just wrap my furniture! When I scheduled the move I was quoted it would take 2 hours for a one bedroom 700sqft with everything I listed for them.  Well it took them 4 hours total. We left my place to go to the new place past the 2 hour quote time. The sent two guys which is fine but one of them was in training so that slowed things down.  I wish they were more honest in their quote.  I don‚Äôt appreciate have to pay for two extra hours when I wasn‚Äôt budgeting that.  I did get a text the following day asking how everything went.

Even on weekends and late nights. We felt as though we were his sole focus, even though i am sure he was always helping other clients. What really sold us on Danny was the amount of homes he was selling and helping buyers buy each year. Knowing that he was successfully helping other buyers buy homes of similar price in Seattle, helped give us confidence that he could help us. Danny was also fully supportive when we asked to submit offers for some houses under the asking price that had been on the market for a while and when we wanted to submit an offer well before the offer review date. After barely a month and 7 offers, we had an offer accepted within our budget and for a house that didn't need a major remodel in a neighborhood we wanted. We couldn't ask for more."

When I found my new home in W Palm Beach, I knew I needed to find an AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE moving company. I first inquired with a few movers to make sure I could compare pricing and services available. I was also rushing my move into a three week timeline; so when I first received my quote from Pure Moving, I instantly knew this was my first choice. When I spoke with them on the phone, they set me up with a video call to get an exact price for the move. I booked an appointment immediately on the first call, I was so confident they would give an affordable rate with impeccable service. I WAS CORRECT, PURE MOVING DOES NOT DISAPPOINT!
Since I was moving from Miami to WPB, it was important for me to have enough movers to get it all done at one time. Five packers and three unloaders were assigned to help with the move. i was PLEASANTLY SURPRISED by their thorough job at packing my ALL WHITE furniture. They took their time, while I went ahead to wait at my new home for another service appointment that day. They made sure everything was EXTRA NEAT AND TIDY when they left the old house. I gave them the key, and they locked up behind them, making my move even easier than expected.
Once, the unloaders arrived they took there time to set everything up in the new home. They were careful that everything was done before calling it a day. Danill and his team REALLY EXCEEDED ANY AND ALL EXPECTATIONS!! I will absolutely keep them in mind in the future when I need to move again, or if a friend is looking move as well."
7138,0.17764646464646466,"After researching realtors that specialize in the Brickell market, I found David. I called him on a Saturday about selling my property, and unlike the other realtors I called, he actually answered. He told me he was in New York for the weekend but would reconnect with me on Monday. To my surprise, I was already receiving emails later that day from him about the market value and the selling process.

From there, David was extremely responsive to any questions or concerns I had and demonstrated a true understanding of best practices. From the listing photos, to the showings, I was always impressed. We received an above asking price offer less than a week after it was listed.

We ran into hiccups during the closing process with liens improperly placed by the City of Miami, and David was relentless in getting the liens released. Whether it was the countless phone calls or his in person visits to the City, he made it happen.

I was very fortunate to find David and would trust him again for any other real estate needs in the future."

6813,0.17754329004329006,"I cannot say enough praise for Ranika and Andy's team. The communication with them was outstanding from the start. They faced many challenges throughout our move - street parking, too small of an elevator, massive or odd shape furnishing, etc... They stayed positive and tenacious through it all. Jose R, Jose H, Wilber M, Segundo T, Andy A and Ranika S - they were so careful, professional and frankly, accomplished at  taking apart furniture, wrapping and protecting all of our office equipment and furnishing. I scheduled 2 days and they got it done in 1-day, saving our company money. I scheduled 2 storage units - they were able to get it all in one. They are Tetris-masters! Again, they saved us time and money. I will be calling them for every move - professional and personal. They were AMAZING!"
3107,0.1774873737373737,"Professional, courteous and friendly movers. Great guys overall. I originally would've left a 4 star review docking just 1 star due to some small damages to the furniture that I saw while moving but ultimately I'm leaving a 2 star review.

I reduced more stars due to discovering more severe damages to my furniture while unpacking after movers left. The movers tried their best to consider avoiding any damages to the furniture but their packing methods were lacking.

I regrettably should have said something when I saw some of their methodologies but didn't want to be that guy that told them how to do their job. Since they are the professionals, I trusted they knew what they were doing.

A few examples:
The dents and scratches to my trashcan were caused by them placing their dolly on top of it in the truck. A trashcan might not sound like a big deal but we invested in a more premium one to use as an accent furniture piece, therefore these damages ultimately reduces it's decorative appeal.

The most heartbreaking damages are the tears on my headboard leather. My bed is one of my most valuable pieces of furniture and I ensured to inform the movers of that. Unfortunately this did not prevent the damages. I can overlook the small scratches and dents to the wooden parts of the bed but tears to the leather need to be called out.

The scrapes, dents and white powder covering my cabinet was caused by them flipping it upside down while moving it. They clarified with me if the cabinet was full and I informed them that yes it was full. By flipping the cabinet upside down, the baking soda inside spilled all over it and also caused the top edges to be scraped.

There were more damages but I only shared these three to avoid writing a review more lengthy than it already is and still get the message across.

Conclusion:
It pains me to write this review since the movers worked so hard and I really appreciated their positive personalities but the company owners and other shoppers need to understand the company's areas of opportunities through honest reviews.

Movers: Andres, Indio, Pedro"
7474,0.17719887955182076,My wife and I had to move across the country from Washington to Florida during the pandemic while also giving birth to our 2nd daughter. Because of this we did not have the ability to fly out and see any houses so we had to do this all virtually. Also with the current market the houses were going very quickly and so we needed to act fast if we found the right house. We had a different RE agent before Geoffrey and had put offers on 5 different houses that didn‚Äôt even get considered. We got recommended to work with Geoff and the first home we put an offer on together we not only got accepted but we got everything we asked for. He is extremely responsive and super friendly and helpful throughout the whole process. We would not have gotten our place without working with him and would highly recommend him and will only be using him going forward.

I will highly recommend them to anyone trying to find movers!
6875,0.17694805194805197,"I was skeptical, but went with Richr based on the other positive reviews knowing I'd save thousands in commissions from a traditional listing service. I honestly didn't expect them to do much. I was very pleasantly surprised,  as the whole team was very helpful and put in a lot of more work than I expected to get my home closed.  Wendy and Serena are superheroes! Great experience all around. If you're in the fence,  get off and go with Richr. I'm glad I did."
11285,0.1768518518518519,"Mary Cha at Weisbarth & Associates was an exceptional realtor.  Her help in selling our home was beyond expectations.  We had found and bought a condo much sooner than expected and our house was not quite ready to sell.  Easter weekend was coming soon and we wanted the house on the market the weekend before.  So we had a really short time to get the house ready.  Mary took charge and arranged a handyman to do several small repairs, got home and sewer inspections scheduled, scheduled deep cleaning, restorative carpet cleaning, staging and photo shoot.  She recommended a great selling price and four days after listing we had four offers and accepted one that was 5% above the listing price.  Mary's advice was great.  Our carpet was old and not attractive.  Mary said that it would be fine after restorative cleaning and it was.  Mary also ran some errands for us that I didn't expect from a real estate agent.  I wholeheartedly recommend Mary Cha as your real estate agent!"
10589,0.17683792815371766,"As we began our relocation from Asia to the USA we made a list of cities that met our needs and Dallas was our first choice. We contacted Dallas Luxury Realty through their website and their agent Warren Barreto contacted us and thus began our rewarding experience with Warrent.

During our first visit in January, Warren lined up dozens of homes and condos to show us the variety of neighborhoods and housing had to offer. During our subsequent visits we settled on the Las Colinas area as it met all our needs and wants and though the first couple of offers we made fell through, two others were locked up in offers hours before we made ours and one needed extensive work beyond original estimates, we finally found a home.

Warren took the time to get to know what we wanted and then focused his time on finding us options. It is never easy to try and relocate but relocating from 9500 miles away is even harder when the market is as tight as it is right now in Dallas where many properties don't stay on the market but days.

We'd recommend Warren hands down as a patient, thorough and Realtor who follows through and wants to see his clients in the perfect home for them."
10151,0.1767857142857143,My husband and I started looking at houses on a Thursday after first meeting with Chavi and Roy to go over what we were looking for and the Seattle market. We found our home on a Saturday and they were reviewing offers on a Sunday. Due to Chavi‚Äôs knowledge and expertise and her ability to work quickly in a crazy Seattle market we were able to win the bid for our home on our first offer!  I would recommend team Diva to any friends who are looking to buy an home.
7230,0.17676767676767674,"Zach felt more like a teammate than a real estate agent (in a good way). He never pressured us to buy anything and consistently showed us houses we were genuinely interested in. He was in regular contact even when there weren't houses in our budget on the market. And when we finally found our dream home, Zach helped us negotiate down $11k from the asking price. Zach is everything you want in a real estate agent. Even after the purchase, Zach has sent several gifts and called several times. I'd use him again in a heartbeat and I recommend him wholeheartedly."

One thing that potential clients should know is that Rob is a shark! He comes across as very easy-going and friendly, but when it comes to watching out for his clients, he is incredibly shrewd and can play hard ball. But he does it in such a skillful way that the other agent doesn‚Äôt know what hit them until it‚Äôs too late! I highly recommend Rob to everyone."

3797,0.17608333333333331,"We were prepared to move from our home of 26 years last summer, and we found 3 bids. We are pretty serious pack rats, so it was a huge undertaking. Easy Moving was competitive with one other bid, but came across as much more organized, communicative and professional. We have zero regrets in hiring Easy Moving. They were punctual and friendly, and VERY good at what they do. Their team worked unbelievably hard for two very long days, and performed Tetris miracles to fit it all in the truck both days, so that a 3rd day wasn't necessary. They did a great job moving everything where we needed it, including some very heavy items, and not one thing was lost or damaged! Highly recommend."
8242,0.17592592592592593,"Not the best company out there, 14hrs to pack and move a 2 bedroom apartment from Frisco to DFW (45min driving distance). The guys who packed our stuff only dumped everything together into boxes (shoes and clothes, cleaning chemicals and food, etc); no common sense at all. The guys who moved our stuff, took 11hrs only to take things to point A to point B and broke a dozen of things and furniture also was damaged. And no, they never paid anything although they said they would.
I had previously moved from Houston to Frisco, so I have a pretty good idea what to expect from a moving service company and what i got is not nearly good enough."
60,0.17585633116883118,"This review is long overdue! I used Phoenix for a cross-country move from Texas to New York, which happened to be scheduled amidst a major snow storm! My biggest considerations in choosing a moving company were reviews / level of care, responsiveness, availability, and cost, and Phoenix Express checked all of these boxes. With Phoenix Express, you coordinate directly with the owners of the business during planning and throughout the move. They responded patiently to my laundry list of questions and helped with accommodating my budget. The moving team was professional, efficient, and careful with my belongings, which stayed on one truck throughout the trip, reducing the risk of breakage that could occur if transferred to different trucks/drivers! The team monitored the weather reports for the storm and adjusted their route accordingly (and also shared guidance for my own drive), arriving at my destination within a matter of days and on schedule. With Phoenix Express, there is no guessing about when your belongings will arrive, which makes it much easier to plan your move. You do pay more for a small, family-owned business, but you can expect top-notch service and care. I highly recommend that you choose Phoenix Express for your local and distance-moving needs!"

7907,0.17551282051282052,"Working with Rob has been an absolute pleasure. His attention to detail and knowledge of the area/market is extremely comprehensive. Rob made sure that we considered everything and gave us helpful tips and strategies. His experience definitely gave us a leg up in this very competitive housing market. Rob also made himself extremely accessible to us whenever a house became available that we wanted to view. We toured houses in the evening and when we could not make it to one, he took a video for us so that we could still see the house. We ended up finding a house and closing on it within less than a month - Rob made the offer and closing process extremely efficient and easy to follow.

Carlos was already at the new home before his men arrived speaking to my family to coordinate placement of the household items that were coming.

They moved our household goods from a 2nd floor apartment to a split level home, in the snow, with no complaints! All of the furniture they had to take apart they put back together, without being asked! I would 1000% recommend Pure Moving to anyone! Moving is hard enough, let them make the process a bit easier!"
3860,0.17510416666666667,"I would give this company actually 4.25 - 4.5 stars if I could.

5 + stars for the movers themselves, they were ROCK STARS (they called when they were 30 minutes out, they arrived on time, they worked efficiently and carefully, they shrink wrapped and blanketed all furniture   and they were very professional).

And 3.5 to 4 stars for the gentleman who help me set up the move. Very hard to get a hold of (by phone, email, text, etc.). Mailbox always FULL so couldn't leave voice mails, emails were not answered in a timely matter and never did receive answers to texts I sent (because of this I almost went with another company).

It is great if your company is so busy that you can't communicate in a timely matter with existing/potential customers. My advice would be to hire more sales reps so you don't lose those customers.

Would use again and would recommend to family and friends."
4593,0.17507440476190475,"Wow, what a day! Andy and his team of 4 were punctual, communicative and worked swiftly! Our move was from two different homes into one home- all different areas. They were careful with all items, worked as a team with tricky bed frames. Communicated beginning, and answered my questions about the double time drive. We checked in after each location and arrived promptly to the next one. It does make a huge difference with a team of four. We filled a 30ft truck perfectly literally no more room to spare.üòÖ

Their tetris skills was on point, thank god!

When arrived (end of day- mind you) The team still took care to pay attention to their surroundings and ask where furniture goes and moved forward immediately.

I never once felt like he was trying to place undue pressure to buy a home; he built a lot of trust in the process, especially once our offer was accepted and we were off to the races.

4959,0.17433862433862435,"I hired Pure Movers for two recent moves and came away pleased both times.

Adam and his crew were hardworking professionals. They did a great job packing and took extra care to made sure everything was well protected. Adam made sure I was happy with how the furniture was reassembled and where it was placed. Weather conditions were terrible during unloading; they worked through a literal hailstorm and kept things moving efficiently. Some boxes and furniture did get wet and there were some wet/mud stains on the carpet but given the weather, it's mostly understandable.

Isa and his crew completed a grueling 10 hour move without missing a beat. They took extra care with the carpets, going so far as to take off their shoes when moving stuff onto carpeted areas which I really appreciated. During the move, a wooden dining table was scratched. More unscrupulous movers would have rushed to hide their mistake, but Isa pointed it out when I didn't even notice. Pure Movers took responsibility for the scratch and their general manager, Frank, offered a reasonable compensation. That's how you know you can trust Pure Movers. Even if there's an issue, they'll make it right.

For people who want extra peace of mind, Pure Movers offer TV/monitor insurance at the current rate of $29 for <$1500 and $49 for $1500-$3000. I got the insurance for 2 large TVs and even though it was ultimately not needed because there was no damage, I don't regret it for the peace of mind."

On moving day, Jorge and his team were on time, incredibly fast and efficient, professional, and no-compromises. They didn‚Äôt waste any time and the move was done right on time - and cheaper than any of the other offers I‚Äôd gotten in the end.

No additional charge for stairs only a trip fee. Our move was done in the minimum of two hours with three movers, but we did set them up for success by disassembling everything prior and having our belongings boxed up.

Tod took better pictures, was more responsive, and did a better job walking us through the process than the ""full-service"" realtor.  I never once felt that the cheaper price impacted the service I received.  Tod actually found and corrected the mistakes made by the buyer's (3%) agent .

10712,0.17292768959435628,"The Real Estate Gals were a great team to have on our [buyers'] side when we purchased a home last year. I have read and strongly disagree with the negative review left below.

We worked with both Johnine and Scott, who both expended a lot of effort and time to understand what we were looking for in a home - which was a challenge due to our multi-family needs with preferences for large scale project space, but close to work in Seattle and in a tight budget. They quickly and accurately gauged what would work for us and helped us sift through the options with frank and straightforward feedback. When the perfect house finally turned up at the end of a long day touring around King County with us, they then burned some serious midnight oil slamming together the aggressive and fast-tracked offer that turned out to be critical for us securing our home.  From my perspective, I cannot overstate the value of having a buyer's agent actually care enough to go these extra miles. I wouldn't be writing this from such a perfect home if it weren't for this team. I can only imagine these qualities have made them even better as agents during the pandemic. The Real Estate Gals will always have our gratitude - thanks especially to Johnine and Scott!"

12022,0.17272727272727267,"Geoff helped us sell our townhouse in Wallingford and also buy a house in Seattle. Start to finish Geoff was outstanding. My wife and I appreciated working with Geoff - if I were to list everything that was positive it would be too long to read, so here's a summary:
-Geoff was totally honest and upfront throughout. We always knew his advice, and always felt empowered to make our own decisions. This included advice that was sometimes hard to follow through on - like moving ourselves and our two small children out of our townhouse, cleaning it up, including painting, and then staging it. This required us to move into an apartment, so that we could get the funds from the sale, and then be competitive in the very hot Seattle market (this was spring 2022). Geoff did not pressure us but was forthright about what he saw as the upsides to that approach.
-Geoff's advice proved out: We followed his advice, received substantially more than we expected from the sale of our townhome, which in turn allowed us to look at homes that would have been out of reach without his guidance. Geoff reviewed offers with us when they came, and was detailed about the up and downsides of the multiple offers we received. It's hard to explain complicated considerations in a way that makes others feel like they get it - Geoff did that throughout.
-Geoff worked tirelessly to help us find our new home. Geoff showed us a multitude of listing, offered his thoughts on what we saw but in a way that felt fact focused and not at all pressured. So, for example, when we saw a place we really liked, Geoff was supportive but also noted some substantial updates the place would need that would add to the cost. When we saw places we were ""meh"" about, that we could have gotten relatively easily, Geoff inquired about our ambivalence - this is to say that he could have made a sale faster, and never worked to do so instead consistently working to ensure we found something we really liked. We saw home after home, got beat out on one, and got the other - yes, just two offers in a wild market. Definitely attribute our easier experience to Geoff."
5861,0.17261904761904762,"2nd time using them. Nothing but excellent!! Carlos and his crew go above and beyond. Professional, nothing broken and they have great communication. Really hard to find trusted movers like this in the Miami area."

I even had remind them to send it. When I read them email, I find that they want me to submit pictures of everything prior to and post move. They also want original receipts of all the items damaged. After getting all of this together they want you have the form notarized. They know good and well that they made it more difficult than it's worth. It's not like they are going to replace everything. The email stated that they are only covered at $0.60 per pound. Just avoid yourself the hassle and use someone else."

4080,0.1716714766714767,"WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

We worked with Harry at Every Door Real Estate and he was incredibly professional and broke down each step of the home buying process at our first meeting. He was patient with our initial financing, and didn't wait to start sending us over homes to check out. Once our financing ran through we hit the ground running, and he setup several viewings all the way in Marysville even though he was based in Seattle. Our first offer was somewhat competitive, but was not accepted (due to the crazy marked and it going $100K over asking). However Harry was right back on the ball with making sure we knew there would be a home for us, and given we had about 2 months we were looking all over. We sent him a house we really liked and upon seeing it had passed the offer review date and was still listed, he reached out for us that minute and found there were no offers put on it. He let me know if we wanted this house we need to make an offer that moment, and after my wife and I spoke we agreed and asked him to draft the offer and move forward. I was wanting to offer more knowing the market, but he assured me at listing would be fine, and after following up they only wanted us to see the place before accepting. Our offer was accepted on our way to see the home, and we fell in love with it as soon as we stepped inside! They received several calls shortly after the offer was accepted regarding other offers, so Harry's quick response and dedication to helping us secure the home quite literally got us it by mere minutes, and he likely saved us a ton of money! We would both highly recommend Harry and by the looks of it anyone at Every Door Real Estate. This company truly has the best of the best!"

Our new house is 2 stories with all the bedrooms and laundry room upstairs so it was a difficult job, but I swear they had everything unloaded in like 45 minutes!

Every step of your move is supervised by a manager or owner of the company. They keep track of everything along the way. It was the first time that Phoenix Express had moved someone to Oregon, and the driver drove extra hours over the mountains to beat approaching winter storms in December to make sure that our move went smoothly on arrival.

In the DFW metroplex there are multiple realtors and you are better off going with someone that actually cares about your needs. I also referred her a friend of mine to rent her property in Frisco. Rach Potter screened & vetted out a tenant with her fee being the deposit. Shortly after, the tenant  was evicted and trashed the entire place. The owner tried to call Rach to get an understanding as to why she chose this person and talk about the fee she took, as the tenant was evicted. Rach ghosted her and never called her back. As I mentioned you are better off with a realtor that actually cares about your needs and not just to make money. I would never work with Rach and her team again nor will I EVER refer her anyone"

Johnine and Tonya met with us before the pandemic and remained super patient and helpful with us as we went hot/cold on whether or not to buy *several times* over the past few years. When we finally found the home we eventually bought, Tonya's help, advice, and feedback were all invaluable to us. She was also super responsive to calls and texts, and was just great to work with in general!

1848,0.16984848484848483,"Long post, but worth it with the explanation given.
My husband and I have been looking for a home in a gated community for nearly 4 years now. With that said, waiting for a home, in this type of community, took considerably longer than one might expect, however our realtor, Crystal Anderson, never gave up on us. She was patient, communicated with us on potential homes coming onto the market, and truly went above and beyond what we could have asked for. While we were also patient, whenever a home did come onto the market, the minute we emailed her with questions, she was incredibly quick to respond. Again, the homes in the given area of search where in high demand, and having Crystal research all of the information needed, in order to proceed with making an offer, truly was seamless.
If you ever see the name, Crystal Anderson, through your search with Every Door Real Estate, reach out to her. You couldn't be in better hands!"

I moved again in May of 2018 and used AM Moving for the second time. They were as courteous and efficient as the first move. I can't sing their praises enough. If you want a well-priced and stress-free mover, go with AM. I was really pleased to learn that they offer discounts for repeat customers, too!

PREVIOUS REVIEW:

I moved yesterday -- July 29, 2016. It was the best experience I've had with movers, and I've moved frequently over the years. They were 5 minutes early and worked fast and efficiently for 4 hours. They were friendly, too, which made the experience less stressful overall.

My mattress did get gouged but that was the only damage I've seen throughly the process. I'll be using them for my next move (but hopefully not for a few years... Moving is a pain.)"
2956,0.1696969696969697,"Working with Katie Melton from Every Door Real Estate has been such an amazing process - I'm actually almost sad that it's over because Katie is an absolute dream to home shop with. My fianc√© and I are first time home buyers with no shortage of questions and Katie has been at our sides 24/7. After just one meeting with Katie, she was able to come up with the perfect listing that met all of our criteria - no easy task, as oftentimes, our Zillow searches resulted in one person loving a home, and the other hating it. Katie found us our dream home (on her first try) and stayed up late the night before offers were due to come up with a last minute adjustment to our offer that ultimately ended up being the reason we won. Katie is the type of agent who will work around the clock to make her clients hopes and dreams come true. She is savvy, responsive and all about her clients' happiness. I am so deeply grateful that I had her as my agent. Thank you so much Katie and the Every Door team!"

They were respectful and you could tell they were working hard to be done as quickly as possible while still getting the job done right. They put everything where it needed to go in the new place, and left no trace of their move behind. They advised me of any potential issues ahead of time.

We discussed what we were looking for, and he set up the MLS portal for us to review houses that sounded like what we wanted.

He's got a very analytical mind for homes (and everything that goes with that), but he's also very personable. Once we found a place we liked, we discussed our buying strategy, and it all went the way we'd hoped. Our offer was accepted, and we flew through all the process that happens after that.

1803,0.16770772238514176,"Easy Company Moving was recommended to me by Missy over at Extra Space Storage in Seattle, after some failed attempts at finding movers that weren't overpriced or seemingly unprofessional.  Missy's recommendation to use Easy Company Moving was very much appreciated.  Kyle Carson (the owner) provided a timely and reasonable estimate.  He was extremely communicative and thorough in ensuring he understood my moving needs.  He was professional, yet very kind.  On the day of the move, August 3, 2020, he arrived with Haku and they had my apartment contents loaded onto the truck in about 45 minutes (I had a one bedroom but many of my boxes were in storage).   Both Kyle and Haku handled all items, boxes and furniture with absolute care.  And for the straggling items, they simply consolidated those items into these wardrobe boxes in order to minimize the number of trips back and forth to the truck (which as they both indicated saves time and money).  At the destination they unloaded the truck and brought contents to my apartment with the same care.  When all was done, Kyle recalculated the estimate and I actually ended up paying LESS than his estimate.  Which showed just how honest he was about the time involved with the total move, but also showed true integrity on his part.

In the past I have had bad experiences with movers, but Easy Company Moving really was a positive experience.  I wholeheartedly recommend Easy Company Moving. I would also recommend reading through the, ""About"" tab on their website.  Kyle's story is pretty awesome and has clearly shaped his professionalism and outstanding work ethic. I will definitely use them again for future moves."

2307,0.16682683982683982,"My girlfriend and I were moving from Dallas to Philadelphia, combining furniture from our two apartments and moving into a third-floor walkup unit with no elevator. After hearing countless stories of disaster moves where companies held furniture hostage, we did a lot of research to make sure we found a moving company we could trust. We saw how positive Phoenix Express' reviews were and so chose them. Jeff and Angie were incredibly transparent throughout the entire move and it gave us a lot of peace of mind that we had the direct phone numbers of the owners who answered immediately each time we called. Phoenix also does direct moves, which meant we were not stuck in Philly without our stuff waiting during a two-week window.

During the move our most valuable item, our big screen TV, unfortunately, broke. As far as we could tell it was a freak accident and had nothing to do with the moving crew. Regardless, Jeff and Angie made sure we got a brand new TV, no questions asked, they replaced it and paid full price. We could not be more thankful we used Phoenix Express, because we know this would not have been the case with another company.

Finally, the day of the move Philly was experiencing a heat-wave with a heat index of 110 degrees. The movers did not complain once, despite our apartment being on the third floor of a very tight stairwell and the unit had an even tighter stairwell inside. They did not scratch the walls or break a single item during the move-in, which was truly amazing and just goes to show Phoenix Express' attention to detail. This is my first review on Google, despite being a member for years, but we felt strongly because of how positive our experience was with what is typically an unpleasant experience. We really could not be happier we used Phoenix Express."

She has a deep knowledge and expertise of the local Seattle-area housing market. Throughout our entire home-buying process she was dedicated, determined, and organized in a way that greatly simplified our house purchasing experience. She also has a background in architecture that also  to an amazing attention to detail - she pointed out several important details to houses we were considering that would likely have gone unnoticed by other realtors. Throughout our process she was communicative, empathetic, and we never felt pressured to make a decision at any point. She is incredibly honest, and helped guide us to realize what things were absolute must-haves for our first house, and other considerations that were less important to us that we didn't realize at the start of our search. When it finally came to putting in an offer, she helped us negotiate a strong offer (talking us through different tactics and trade-offs) that was accepted!

I had booked a 26 foot U-Haul truck and the day before the move I was told by U-Haul that they had no 26 foot trucks and I would have to go get a 20 foot truck from over 30 miles away... I was less than thrilled. I got up early and went to get the truck and could see immediately there is no way that everything was going to fit. I felt pretty defeated and beaten down but I knew that I had to get back to meet the movers.

In comes Jalen and Chris. I told them off the bat that I was very sure that everything was not going to fit and that I would be happy if we were able to get all the furniture at least and most of the boxes. They walked the house and came up with a game plan and boy did they knock it out of the park! I have never in my life seen a truck packed as well or as tight as the truck they packed for me! I was astonished at the work that they did that day. We loaded almost the entire house in 2 hours and 15 min. Everything was done so fast while also being careful and accurate! In the end just as I had feared not everything fit but the things that didn't fit were minimal and I was able to get the rest in a single load. (Absolutely no complaining there) I don't have a single complaint about the work they did! I actually paid their bill with a smile on my face knowing that these guys were worth every penny!"

10318,0.16562770562770562,"We can't thank Danny enough for his dedication and expertise in helping us finally secure our dream home!

Back tracking to 2017, my first meeting with Danny Greco was all about Home Buying 101. Danny was knowledgeable and patient, as I knew absolutely nothing about the process. He was also understanding when I decided to hold off on purchasing a condo as a single person. I received his newsletters each month as a means of tracking the market.

Fast forward to Spring 2023, I reached out to Danny once again. We picked up right where we left off, except this time, I was looking for a single family home with my life partner. Danny was able to accommodate my new adjustments with ease and build a strong rapport with not only us as his clients, but also with all the listing agents involved. His communication, transparency, and experience gave us a sense of ease in our house hunting journey. His coaching & strategy, especially after we lost some initial bids, helped us recoup and regain momentum.

If you're seeking a real estate agent who goes above and beyond, Danny is the one to trust. Even my future in-laws are working with Danny for their own house hunting in Seattle!"

No matter if we contacted her early in the morning or late at night, she almost always gets back to us instantly.¬† After we told her we wanted to put in an offer, our house was under contract in a few hours with her speedy work and strong negotiation.

Highly recommended."
6402,0.16542699724517904,"The amount that you're quoted is the minimum they have to charge you. So my estimate was $2500: which is a bed, desk, chair, 3 boxes realistically.

For example, if you only take your bed but leave behind everything else - they still have to charge you the minimum estimate.

Another pro tip, make sure your price per cf is average to $5, don't sign the quote until you're financially ready to make that price. Mine was averaged to 8.50 per cf bc I'm going to a different state.

Thankfully they're nice enough to work with you. Tony, Cayden, Muhammad, and Joe were super nice and helpful.

At the end of the day, sell your stuff and buy brand new furniture."

1871,0.1653014842300556,"Overall we did not have a very good experience. The movers were very polite and friendly, however, the move itself took about twice as long as anticipated and we incurred damages. The crew was not able to get all of our belongings on the truck which left of us with several additional trips to make. (We anticipated needing to make a few trips, but never thought we'd triple the number.) We had several damaged pieces of furniture as well; a dining room table, dining room console, bed, dressers, patio table and chair set, our BRAND NEW refrigerator. I don't feel that the appropriate care was taken to protect against damages. We selected this company based on reviews and pricing. What we experienced may have just been an off day for the crew but we would certainly not use these services again."
11545,0.16524426807760142,"TLDR: super knowledgeable, lightning fast communication, patient as a saint, and just really rad.

Geoff is ridiculously awesome. I threw a completely bizarre situation at him and he handled it with ease and skill. I was in the midst of a complete personal crisis and believed I needed to move from Albuquerque to Seattle immediately... with two dogs and two cats, knowing absolutely nothing about home ownership or the process that leads to it. I messaged him on Yelp not really knowing what to expect, but 45 minutes later, on a Sunday night, I pulled over in a sad Walmart parking lot and he talked me down. This falls entirely outside his job description, and  you will hopefully never find yourself in a similar predicament, however I feel it truly demonstrates Geoff‚Äôs ability to deal with emotional/slightly deranged people with a cool head and rational reasoning (which is very useful when looking at houses!) He is highly adaptive and an excellent problem solver. He was also so, so very patient when dealing with someone who was completely clueless and uniformed about the housing market in general and the unique situation in Seattle. He explained the perils of trying to shop long distance in such a hot market, which made complete sense. After I accepted that the timing and logistics weren‚Äôt right, I put our conversation out of my mind. Geoff thoughtfully touched base about six months later with updates on the market and the possibility of finding something close to the specifications I originally made. His emails were always impeccably detailed and informative, and his response time was unheard of. When I visited Seattle for vacation a few months later he whipped up a list of places that fit my criteria in no time and arranged for me see them with short notice. He was never pushy or controlling, but always listened and provided informative feedback. He understood that I wanted a creaky old house but knew that I wouldn‚Äôt be up for fixing it up myself. His attention to detail about potential issues and maintenance problems when touring 100+ year old homes was invaluable. When I decided to move forward on a house, his speedy input, informed opinions, and network of other great/reliable/fast people in the field was such an asset when negotiating and closing. I‚Äôm still not totally sure how I was able to successfully purchase a house, the answer must be Geoff. He really is great."

6586,0.16463650793650791,"We officially closed on our dream home last month after working with Doron and the Weisbarth associates since the summer. This will be our second home purchased with Doron; my husband bought his first townhome in 2019 and we knew well before we were seriously interested in buying again that we'd be working with Doron again (and again).

Whether you are a first time buyer, downsizing, looking for something larger, or selling, you can be sure that you will be 100% happy working with this team. Some highlights and anecdotes worth sharing which were important to us:

- It is a tough market. Low inventory and rising interest rates meant we needed a true expert to manage our expectations on timing and ultimately close quickly. With decades of experience and a large network of contacts, Doron was able to leverage subject matter expertise to advise on historic trends for influx of inventory, and simply be a sounding board to us when emotions were running high to ensure we stayed grounded and aligned on our true north.

- To my previous point, Doron gave us so much patience. It took ~5 months to find the RIGHT house for us. That's not to say we didn't find other houses that we thought were right. There were several times we considered extending an offer, or went through the process of putting together an offer which (fortunately) did not work out. In those instances, we were being pushed on our baseline needs or even price range. It would have been easier for Doron to push us toward buying a house and getting a deal closed. However, there are several times which I can recall where he told us the (too expensive) home was beyond our budget, or gave us a genuine, solicited, advice on his point of view with flags or features in a home that he didn't care for (I.e. too dark, or something he thinks we would grow out of in a few years). Doron is direct and sincere. On a few occasions, family was in town when we went to look at houses together. They noted how ""un-pushy"" the experience was and how we all learned a lot (i.e. what to look for on low quality house flips, quality build, creative ideas for home renos).

- When we *did* find the perfect home, there were several competing offers and it was really neck and neck. Doron shared network contacts, specifically a known and trusted lender who would be able to support a ~14 day close period, which was a lever that helped our offer to be selected. Since closing, Doron has continued to check in, offer insight, and provide additional recommendations on contacts (flooring, contractors etc).

Our experience working with this team was so enjoyable. In fact, I told my husband ""I'm going to miss hanging with Doron"" on weekends.

We absolutely recommend others to work with this team the next time they are considering purchasing or selling in the greater Seattle market."

The movers were prompt, professional, and efficient. They showed up fairly early in the arrival window, and competently handled the loading and unloading of a wide variety of furniture and boxes.

I would definitely use Eco Movers again in the future."

I knew my pricing upfront and the pricing range was very affordable. They also gave good estimates on how long it would take to move my one bedroom so it really helped me calculate my pricing range. They hit the nail on the head with the estimates on time and pricing. It ended up taking less time than I thought. My movers Hugo, Paul, and Alfredo made the moving process so seamless!

Satch and Ethan handled both the situations with a smile on their face which was great to see.

We changed our mind, we updated what we were looking for, we got cold feet. And through the whole thing, the team couldn't have been better.

The absolute best part for us was that their team wasn't afraid to have an opinion. They never forced their opinion on us, but if we asked, they had a POV. They weren't trying to two-sides every answer or sit on the fence about things. If they thought we wouldn't like a house, they'd say it. If they thought we were being too picky or too blind or too whatever, they'd say so. It was so, so refreshing. Like home shopping with friends, not Realtors.

11410,0.16233974358974362,"Hello, future homeowners!

Let me begin by saying this: Geoff Hill is the f@#cking best. I sincerely cannot recommend him enough.

My husband and I were first-time homebuyers‚Äîand had absolutely no idea what we were doing. Geoff, was kind, patient, an extremely knowledgeable. He guided us through the entire process, literally and figuratively holding our anxious hands the whole time.

Geoff showed us (not exaggerating) hundreds of homes in a period of 8 months. And throughout that arduous time, Geoff never pushed us, never tried to ‚Äúsell‚Äù us, never grew impatient, and always kept our best interests as his top priority.

He spent time with us, jumping on a call even while he was out of town, to talk us through any and every question we had (we had a lot!). Geoff also helped answer questions that we didn‚Äôt even know we had‚Äîwith tons of expertise and know-how gained from his years of experience in the hectic Seattle market.

Geoff is funny and normal! I know that‚Äôs an odd thing to add. But, my perception of cheesy realtors was smashed with Geoff. Geoff is great to chat with‚Äîwhich is important because, again, we saw a LOT of him.

Ultimately, Geoff helped us find our dream home‚Äîand did it when the market was insane. He also helped us negotiate and time everything perfectly, so we even got it at under asking (essentially unheard of).

Geoff is amazing. And you should hire him as your realtor. You won‚Äôt regret it."

It was a busy time in my family's life, expecting our second child and needing more space. She navigated our home sale, working with us to get the home ready for sale and ultimately selling it for full asking price after just seven days on the market. She made the process as easy as possible, and Team Diva really excels in how they go above and beyond other firms in their marketing. I can't recommend Lindsy and Team Diva enough!"

For the ease and convenience that came along with her service I would have gladly paid for it and not even thought twice. So thanks again Katie!

Through timely happenstance, I became connected to Every Door Real Estate and in particular their agent, Katie Sheaffer.  Katie provided expert tutelage when it came to narrowing down neighborhoods that aligned to what I was looking for, guided me through the offer and negotiation process (even challenging my own stubborn assumptions when necessary!) and made closing on the home a breeze.  I am grateful for the opportunity I had to work with both Katie and her extended resources within the brokerage.  Would highly recommend for anyone in the market."
3838,0.1617133743449533,"The PURE Moving Team was fantastic.  They helped us move from Issaquah to Sammamish and did a far better job than expected.  I pre-moved some of our items due to negative past experiences with other moving companies, but these guys were so good that I should have just had them move everything.

The team was on-time, worked non-stop, and took excellent care of every single item that they moved.  This included a number of fairly fragile items that arrived at our new home in perfect condition.  In addition, the final bill was less than the quote.

Highly recommended and will use again in the future."

His ability to present information objectively as well as offer his professional opinion is something we valued a lot throughout the process. Every step of the way went as smoothly as possible because the Every Door team was quick, responsive, and thorough; Bill was open, accessible, and went to bat for us when it really counted. As exhausting and draining as the home buying process can be, Bill made it feel manageable and knowing that we were first time home buyers, broke it down into understandable chunks and really held our hands the entire way.

Boris, Glenn, and Lon were an amazing team. Arrived exactly when they said they would. They hustled all day in the summer heat. Great communication, no hiccups, nothing broken or even scuffed. No noticeable damage to walls/floors. They wrapped furniture and fragile stuff like our TV in moving blankets and plastic wrap to prevent damage. Before moving anything they put down runners to avoid damaging the floor.

Final cost was within 10% of estimate, and we had way more stuff than was on the pre-move inventory (we forgot about stuff in storage).

Customer service reached out a few days before, the day of, and after service to check in, and are available over SMS which was very convenient.

They also offer delivery of moving boxes, which really helped. We got the 2-3 bedroom kit and it had pretty much everything we needed.

Great job all around."
11116,0.15880341880341883,"In sprint 2018, a colleague recommended Team Diva as a Real Estate Agent.  He had twice bought and once sold with the agency - and gave glowing reviews of their quality.  In very early summer 2018, I began my first-ever search to buy a house.  I made an appointment with Team Diva and they answered the plethora of questions I had.  I was assigned to Rocky Flowers.  In our initial interview, he and others with Team Diva talked about what interests I had, what were MUST haves/nice-to-have, locations, house/condo/townhouse, etc.  It was a great conversation.  After this conversation, they were keen to understand what I was l seeking - this is a great skill!

From there, they narrowed down some properties which we visited over the next week or two.  As luck would have it - the _very_ first house that I went to was the one I fell in love with.  And, it turns out, that's the house I bought!

As a first-time home-buyer, it was critical for me to have the guidance, leadership, and support of an experienced local group such as Team Diva.  Rocky and team were with me every step of the way down the incredibly complex process of real-estate purchases (don't even get me started on the sewer-line inspection process which turned up some nasty surprises that were corrected prior to close!).  I always looked forward to texts/emails/phone calls from Rocky.  Heck, he even was doing important work for me at 9:30 PM during some critical points of the process.  You can count on Team Diva to be 100% available and on your side 24x7 during the process.

I plan to be in my house for a long time, though when the time comes to buy and/or sell again - I will absolutely use Team Diva as my real estate partner.  I also have recommended them to friends or colleagues who are exploring the home-buying process.

Thanks so very much to Rocky and Team Diva for making my first-time home-buying process much smoother than it otherwise would have been!"

Long story short, we did most of the work ourselves late into the night and had a hangry fight that tested our relationship. So this time around, we knew we wanted to hire a real professional service. We chose Eco Movers for this move after reading lots of positive reviews online. Our team of movers was led by Boris, an experienced professional and skilled project manager. His crew included Julian and Austin, both of whom were hard working, careful, and friendly. Our move took all day, so Fran joined us at our destination to make unloading and reassembling quicker work, and when the moving truck almost couldn‚Äôt make it backing up our very steep driveway, Fran‚Äôs confident driving made it work. We are still unpacking boxes at our new place and fully exhausted from moving, but Eco Movers was a game changer for us. Thank you, Boris, Julian, Austin, and Fran!

9159,0.15737821766047574,"WaLaw is the answer for tech-savvy home shoppers. The amount of money we saved by simply being able to use freely available online MLS sources is unbelievable.  Setting up automatic new listing alerts is easy and saved us thousands of dollars (covered our entire closing fees with enough left over to lower our interest rate!).

It‚Äôs important to note, however, that less expensive does not mean no frills.  We found WaLaw agents, Marc and Kim, Jason and Claire,  to be incredibly responsive and communicative. They included us on every email possible and kept us in the loop constantly.  They toured numerous homes with us giving their valuable opinion and had what it took to close a home in a very seller-friendly Ballard market.

I think most importantly WaLaw are not just real estate agents, but also real estate lawyers.  They advise on the state of paperwork and look for important details that we had no idea about.   They noticed a missing tax requirement form in our final paperwork that could have cost us months down the line.

We have no doubt that many real estate agents can fulfill your needs but WaLaw did everything we wanted and more for a fraction of the cost (We had around 70% savings!)

We cannot recommend them enough and will be recommending WaLaw to all of our friends. We will look forward to working with WaLaw the next time when we need to buy or sell a house."

We began our search in January as first-time home buyers, completely unfamiliar with the process, and clueless as to what to look for in such a large investment. They always made us feel like their number one priority even though we knew they were juggling many other clients, accommodating and adjusting schedules when we reached out to them about prospective homes. Not once did we feel pressured or rushed to put in an offer‚Äî in fact they had joked early on that they probably spent more time discouraging than encouraging their buying clients. The complement of Geoff‚Äôs astounding technical knowledge of houses (building materials, electric, plumbing, costs of usage and replacement, etc), and Kelly‚Äôs warm and effusive approach to how to actually make a potential house a home was just what we needed to know that when we finally made an offer, we were making the right choice.

EDIT 1: Our movers wore their masks for the first 5 minutes of meeting us. After that, the masks came off starting with their crew leader before the heavy lifting even started. It didn't take long for his workers to follow suit. The masks pretty much stayed off or around their chins (which, news alert, does nothing to prevent the spread of COVID-19) until they left. They even damaged some of our furniture.

My partner and I were both repeat customers, and I left a glowing review for this company on Google when they moved us last time. However, the experience this time was so rough that I feel this review just doesn't express how unhappy we were with the overall experience.

EDIT 2: Pretty much a few minutes after writing this review, the operations manager for the company (Joe) reached out to me. I felt he genuinely cared about the negative experience we had with this particular crew and assured me that the issue with the masks was discussed at length and that the crew leader had been let go because the company does, in fact, take the issue of masks extremely seriously. He provided me with a resolution that I felt was more than fair and downright generous. Joe was direct, honest, and I could tell from speaking with him has been doing his best to stay on top of everything. I am not only relieved but very thankful for him and Kent for taking care of us."

I was hesitant as I considered buying my first home during this wild market, but I was lucky enough to partner with Kelly Byrne and the Blue Pacific Real Estate team.  Kelly was involved in the process from start to finish and made the whole thing more enjoyable and much less stressful.  We spent many weekends touring houses and Kelly was always flexible and accommodating with his time.  He was also very responsive when I asked his thoughts on various listings and he even went out of his way to send me potential properties.  Kelly is very knowledgeable and experienced in the real estate industry and he helped me find creative ways to make competitive offers.  After one of my offers was accepted, he was able to explain the intricacies of a fairly complex transaction and guided the deal through closing.

Tod provided me with the same realtor expertise and everything I needed from a realtor as those who charge those high fees. Tod did a great job in providing with guidance on selling my home and insuring the deal got done fast. And Tod is not like many of these realtors who insist on setting a low market value in order to sell your home quickly.

We had everything already boxed and waiting next to the door except our furniture. We felt like the pace of work was unreasonably slow, which was frustrating because you're paying by the hour. The team lead Asan was great- prompt and professional. The other two workers showed up in sweatpants and moved with limited efficiency. Communication leading up to the day was good and they moved us without any damage to either our belongings or to our new house, which we really, really appreciated, but it cost literally double what had been estimated on the phone.

In our first attempt to make an offer, Lily told us that she believed the final price would go far above our budget. While still she worked with us to prepare the offer thoroughly. She explained to us how to use different offer strategies, walked us through the offer documents in details, and she follow-through timely so we built up knowledge on the seller and our competitions. These efforts equipped us with the needed knowledge so we can move fast in our final offer. When we made the final offer on the house we bought, we worked on it together till 1am and we got our offer accepted within 12 hours since the house was listed. During the journey, I was once lost confidence and wanted to offer a max price to win the offer. Lily cooled me down with her objective and comprehensive assessment, and her insights on the seller and their agent. She guided us with combined offer strategies and suggested a price that I thought would be too low to get the house. But we eventually get the house around the price she suggested which was lower than what I anticipant it to be. This was a budget saving for us!

2008,0.15378968253968253,"Found AM Moving while compiling a list of companies to get pricing from for a cross-country move of two apartments (ours and our mother-in-law's in same complex) from Fort Worth to West Palm Beach, FL. Went with AM Moving for several reasons: 1.) Pricing, 2.) Direct move instead of consolidated move (i.e. our stuff went directly from A to B leaving certain day, arriving certain day; larger companies like Mayflower offload your stuff and put on different trucks then schedule according to their routes), and 3.) My initial perception of their customer service. Local company that cares a lot about reputation and growth. They also seemed eager to do a move of this size which was a plus.

Disclaimer: this was my 12th move in 10 years and 5th or 6th cross-country. I've tried all sorts of methods: self-move with U-Haul, consolidated move as described above, etc. This was my most complicated move as we had to move to apartments, multiple vehicles, and I HAD to arrive in a certain narrow time frame due job requirements. I like to think I know a bit about movers and have plenty of experiences to compare this one to.

TLDR: this was the best, smoothest experience I've ever had relative to the complexity / difficulty of the move.

FULL REPORT: I first scheduled a site inspection of my stuff about 2 months in advance of move to get a firm ""not to exceed"" price. I talked to Rod and met with him on-site. He looked at our stuff and within 48 hours gave me a price that was about $3k lower than other Allied. They have an online system for managing the process that's easy to use and well organized. Rod was polite and eager, so I booked them.

I called back several weeks later and asked if they could ship a car. Price they quoted was very good so we added to order. Then a week before we left, my wife an I decided to ship our second car as well. It clearly made things more complicated, but they gave an even better price for the second car and made it work.

First leg of move took two days: 1 to pack both apartments, one to load into two trucks including both cars. In short, everything went very smoothly. John and Paul were polite, focused, efficient, and careful. John sort of ""led"" the whole move including drop off later on and I can't say enough about how lucky AM is to have him. Just solid all around. Crew loaded everything on a Sunday and left the following day).

We worked out that the crew would arrive and unload everything into our storage unit on Wednesday. Sure enough, 8AM Wednesday we met John and Abel (another AM employee; Paul had family obligations and couldn't make the drive for the second half). Both cars arrived on elevated trailers (i.e. better than being towed wheels on the road) and it took them about 3 hours to unpack. After 1200 miles and 4 days of work, their attitude and the care they showed was as good as ever and they crushed through the end of the move issue-free. It could not have been better.

Overall, for what we paid the experience was an absolute A+. I've gotten very lucky recently with moves and several have been good, but this was truly exceptional and the team deserves a ton of credit. They're local but definitely consider them for longer-range moves. Trust me: it makes a world of difference to know when your stuff is arriving and that it will show up not having been offloaded and re-loaded on some highway or truck depot in the middle of nowhere.

Can't say enough about these guys and my perception of the value we got. Shout out to Rod who organized everything and priced it out for us, John who was the boots-on-the-ground QB for everything and worked his tail off the entire time with a good attitude, and Paul and Abel who were professional, courteous, and showed great care in handling our possessions."

The Phoenix folks (Angie and team) came in, and securely and completely packed all my belongings including very large and fragile items, plus all of the small stuff.  They even cleaned up and emptied the old stuff out of the fridge.  Plus, Jeff and the guys had to get the things from my storage locker without having a key.  Then, they loaded my Porsche on a trailer, and they even grabbed my mail for me.  The next day, Jeff, Brandon and Travis (I think I got their names right) delivered all of it to my new place; carrying most of it down to the basement and to the shed in the yard.  They even carried a very heavy desk (that they didn‚Äôt move) upstairs for me.  They were very respectful of me, my new home and my belongings.  Their price was reasonable.

When it finally came time for us to actually make the purchase, Danny met us in Edmonds to physically tour the places we thought would meet our criteria and then helped negotiate the price on our final choice. He was great about keeping us informed as we moved through the process and was pleasant, cheerful and professional throughout. And we want to add kudos to the Keller Williams website. In terms of what we were looking for, it was much more useful to us in our condo search than other MLS websites."

On the day of my scheduled move it was raining, thundering and lightning so I was not sure how well my move was going to be with the inclement weather. I was completely surprised by the service I received from AM Moving Company.  The three gentlemen (Joel, Jesus and George) were respectful, courteous, and careful when packing my belongings and moving them to my new location.  At my final location, the guys were very careful to not dirty my new carpet and utilized the protective liner I purchased for the carpet and some blankets they provided as well. The price and the service received surpassed my expectations and I would definitely refer this team to others in the future."
8495,0.15325670498084293,"Danny was the best thing that happened to us during our home buying process. We had a baby during the pandemic and realized we needed more space, so we decided to buy our first house, however the competition on the housing market was insane early 2021. Houses were being sold merely a few days after the listing date with multiple competing offers. Needless to say, with so much competition, the houses were being sold several thousands of dollars above their listing prices. Danny never let us down. I guess most real estate agents would take advantage of this situation and pressure buyers to always make the highest possible offer. Danny wasn't like that at all. Instead, he always told us to be patient and we would eventually find a good deal. We are happy we followed his¬†advice. We ended¬†up visiting several houses, and Danny went above and beyond to ensure we would be able to visit¬†all the houses we wanted, which wasn't a small feat given all the covid-19 restrictions that were in place during the time. On all the visits, he would share with us his thoughts on the strengths¬†and weaknesses of each house/location so we could make a more informed decision. After a few months of offers being rejected, one of our offers was finally accepted, and we feel that we were able to get a house with everything we always wanted for a fair price. We couldn't be happier about Danny's work and we always recommend him for any of our friends."

534,0.1531024531024531,"We had Darko and Axel help us this time and they were courteous, fast, and detailed while moving us out of a 2nd story apartment with tight stairs. Most honest pricing out of all moving companies I called. No hidden fees. Straight hourly! All other companies wanted to charge me double. Here, 1 bed apartment with everything Boxed and broken down with full dining sets, king bed, appliances, and 30 boxes cost about $640 both times I went to them. Unfortunately I had one item dropped but they claimed fault and paid me right away no questions asked in a week. If you need items more taken care of they do have the option to wrap everything.

This is my 2nd time moving with Wildcats, last time in 2021 I had Darius and Byron. They are beasts! Carrying items by themself and as quick as possible. Tbh I don't think I'm going to another company!

This company is phenomenal!"

They wrapped all of my furniture. They disassembled and reassembled my bed perfectly, which has given movers a hard time in the past because it has a hydraulic lift. The service is very affordable and is all inclusive. I will be utilizing Joshua's services again in the future. Thank you so much for making my move stress-free!"

I had fragile items like a large tv, heavy floor mirror, and desk that needed special attention and nothing was damaged during the move. They handled tight turns and various flights of stairs well, zero marks left on the walls or corners. They also dealt with finding street parking and maneuvering the moving truck to accommodate garbage collection times in a calm manner, which made the entire moving process less stressful on myself. My movers (Baktybek + 1) did an excellent job and I would highly recommend using Pure movers for your next move!"
11630,0.15227272727272728,"I did a lot of research on different companies; spoke to representatives from each one and I must say that Pronto Cash Offers was, by far, the most reasonable and fair company. I understand that in that industry it's all about money, how to maximize their profit. However, there's a point, in my opinion, where in an attempt to maximize their profit, they don't think about the sellers interests/needs. Some of the different companies I contacted made me feel insulted with their offers. Pronto Cash Offers, on the other hand, has a win-win business approach. I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone.. Call them, I guarantee you won't look any further.."
5096,0.15222537878787878,"This is my first time to ever write a google review - that‚Äôs how happy I am with the service I received!

I needed movers last minute, and Megan was so helpful on the phone making sure I got everything set up with them. On the day of the move, I was not able to be there, so my mom filled in for me. She could not quit saying positive things about my assigned movers, Jalen and Marvin. There was a bit of an issue finding my apartment building, but once they got there they were quick to start working. She said they were professional, polite, and worked efficiently. I tried to have everything set and ready for them, and between that and their work ethic, the move ended up being faster and cheaper than quoted. I‚Äôm going to have to move my stuff out of storage in a couple of months, and my mom told me repeatedly that I need to make sure I get Jalen and Marvin again.

I have used other movers before, admittedly a bit cheaper than Wildcat, but they were unprofessional and left me frustrated with the timing of everything. I will definitely be using Wildcat movers again in the future!"

My agent was very responsive and professional, and he really advocated for us throughout the offer process. This was especially important as we were already out of state so good communication was really key. We had a specialty property (small acreage horse property) and were prepared for it to take a while to sell based on other similar properties in our area, but by the end of the day after listing it we had dozens of viewings and multiple offers. We'll be buying another house soon and definitely plan on using RedFin again."
11189,0.15178030303030304,I originally bought my first house with Pickett Street 9 years ago and had a great experience.  When we found our dream home on Whidbey Island recently we reached out again and they worked miracles for us in a crazy market.  Not only did they help us get the dream house in a highly competitive market they did it while simultaneously getting our house on the market and sold including a remodel to help us get top dollar.  From the time we saw our dream house till we closed on our old house and had keys to our new house was 45 days.  I highly recommend this team!
11073,0.15166666666666667,"Ryan was an absolute pleasure to work with. My partner and I went from being potential home-buyers to homeowners within a few weeks, and we owe it all to Ryan and the GHAH team.

We had dipped our toes into the Seattle real estate market in 2021 as potential first-time home-buyers and knew from that short-lived experience that we were well out of our depth. Fast forward to 2024, we approached Ryan and the GHAH team among others with a bit of surface-level knowledge about the home-buying process, plenty of trepidation, and muted expectations.

With all that being said, Ryan and the GHAH team soon blew us out of the water with their professionalism, transparency, and an attentiveness to our needs (and wants!) that made us feel actual excitement towards the home-searching and buying process; not an easy feat. His emphasis on properly educating us as (first-time) buyers and ensuring that we never felt pressured into making an offer‚Äîand accepting undue compromise‚Äîmakes him a standout pick for buying in a market that is as competitive as Seattle's.

Our only ""lament"" would be that we ""only"" worked with him just short of a month. By the third week of looking at places as soon as they were listed, we found a place that exceeded our expectations and had our first offer for it accepted.

The following closing process was as painless as it can get with the GHAH team and Ryan guiding us, and overall we genuinely couldn't be happier. We are confident in recommending Ryan and the Get Happy at Home team for anyone looking to buy in Seattle."
7148,0.1516005291005291,"I hired AB Movers to help with moving furniture and boxes for us in our move across town and I was blown away by the incredibly satisfying experience. I have used movers in the past who were rude, unhelpful, and were obviously taking their time in order to leech more money from the customer. I was hesitant to hire another moving company but I had heard great things about AB and I took chance and I am thrilled that I did. We were assigned Ricky's team (3 men total) and they were EXTREMELY professional, hard and fast working, helpful, polite, and careful. We had some pieces that were antiques and not only did they expertly wrap them for transport, Ricky also took the time to explain to me certain ways to NOT prepare antiques for transport to avoid damaging them. This is important and extremely relevant information for me, as we are going to be moving all of my family's antiques into storage soon. He also visually surveyed my storage unit when we stopped to pick up furniture and helped me realize that the unit I currently have is too small for all the pieces I need to store and explained that their team can also help me move from one storage unit to a larger unit. From start to finish this was an amazing experience. The girl who I booked through on the phone was knowledgeable and helpful, the move went amazingly well (and fast!), and at the end the overall cost (including 3 tips) was almost $500.00 less than what I have paid in the past for movers who weren't half as good. I am so happy with this experience that I will be requesting this same team for the moving of the antiques coming up in the next week or so. I highly recommend hiring AB movers for your moving needs.

Edit/Update: I also hired them again for moving antiques and helping move from one storage unit to another. I worked with Johnathan's team this time and I was every bit as satisfied with their hard work and fast pace. I will be hiring AB movers for any and all moving needs I have in the future."

Not only were they quick, but they were both very personable and put me at ease. They handled everything with the utmost professionalism and were incredibly patient, kind, and careful throughout.

They got to work immediately and didn't stop until all of my items were up on the third floor - in spite of working middle of the day in Texas summer! Friendly, communicative, and reasonable pricing all add up to make this a great moving company to go with."
10951,0.15056776556776555,"Rawlins brought us clarity in an insane market. Several times after viewing properties or on the phone, he took the time (45 minutes to an hour ) to explain the market, manage our expectations, and show us how to approach the market. His approach ended up working for us. It got us:
Looking at the right houses to keep close to our price range
Seller-funded closing costs--this seems like a myth to my other friends who are buying.
Paying asking, and slightly below appraisal, for the home. This last point might be moot in a few years, but in 2021, it's a significant victory.

Like a lot of optimistic buyers, we came into the market with high expectations. Rawlins does a great job managing those expectations and getting you to change your mindset to meet the market where it's at and not where you might like it to be.

He's a great communicator; whether via phone, text, or email--my preference is the latter two--he's willing to use the communication methods you prefer.

He has a team working with him that's great for communication; I don't think I waited more than a few hours ever for an email response.

We didn't use his recommended inspector, but that's because we found our own and had a bad experience using the realtor-recommended inspector in the past.

He referred us to a great lender. They had solid communication and a great application process/paperwork management system.

We had one road bump near the end of the sale--just a small mistake regarding items included in the sale. Rawlins owned it and worked with us to make it right.

We plan to use him to sell our first property without a doubt."

Not a single item of the entire house move was damaged and neither were either locations. Highly recommend this team and company."
3733,0.14925347222222227,"Nothing but good things to say about the group that AM Moving Co sent to help me.
The team included four guys: Navid (leader of the bunch), Lee, Eli, and Miguel.

Pros:

- They were very courteous and called me ahead of time before the scheduled appointment

- They were clean (kind of sad I have to mention this, but in the moving business you really don't know what kind of people you'll get sometimes... a different company who delivered my appliances had a guy who couldn't talk without his spittle flying and splattering all over the place - not exaggerating!)

- They disassembled what I couldn't disassemble, and reassembled it all at the target location (they had a huge toolbox with everything in it)

- They were as careful as possible with my furniture, and most especially my piano which weighs 517lbs (says so on the specs!),

- You could tell they were experienced by how carefully they moved the larger and heavier pieces, as well as the glass tabletops.  Their leader, Navid, coordinated much of these moves very carefully and patiently, got constant input from each of the movers as they were moving my piano every step of the way (especially down the stairs).  They were extremely careful not to get hurt themselves while also giving a ton of care not to damage the items.

Cons: (only one)

- They only chipped a TEEENY tiny bit of paint on the wall of my kitchen... very fixable and hardly an issue considering they carried my upright piano into the house

I HiGHLY recommend these guys for your move.
- If you're moving anything heavy (like a piano) be sure to get four guys for safety please.  Besides that, they also move your stuff a ton faster.
- If you have upstairs especially, make sure you measure the CORNERS.  I made the mistake of not measuring them properly and so they couldn't get my piano upstairs, though they did try (I really appreciated that they tried)

Other notes: Charge for me was $135/hr for 4 guys, min 3 hr charge, and for my particular case since I was moving within the same county, the field charge was $40.  Also, they honor Yelp gift certificates OR vouchers (but not both in conjunction, so choose wisely).
They have a 3% charge if you use credit card, so have a checkbook ready.

Pack well and move the minor stuff if you can, so you don't waste their time by having them lift your clothes hangers or your wineglasses... even little ol' me could handle that by myself in my commuter car.

In my case, I was very happy with their professionalism and some serious skullsweat, and offered them pizza and/or pho noodles from down the street - remember, these guys probably have pizza every time they come out, so I'm sure they'd appreciate the option of variety!"
702,0.14914529914529917,"I had communicated with three other real estate agents in the home-buying process. I eventually communicated with Ron Gates of Every Door Real Estate, and after talking with him, he was one of the only agents to truly take the time to educate us on first time home buying and various courses of actions to take. I recognized his attention to detail and his genuine care for you as a client... Definitely people-first oriented! He never pressured us to buy a home and always provided well-thought out advice. My wife and I worked with Ron Gates to purchase our first home in Washington state. We are out of state buyers coming from Missouri (utilizing the VA Loan) and Ron made the process of buying a home out of state smooth and easy, alleviating any significant friction points that occurred in the home buying process. He established solid communication with us, the lender, the selling agent, the inspector, and the title/escrow company. He will ensure that you are well-cared for and he will protect you from investing in a bad property and from losing earnest money. Furthermore, he also was able to work with us throughout the moving process as well when it came to establishing contractors and a lockbox prior to arrival. He is a very detail-oriented and caring in a manner that would prevent any additional headaches that may slow down the home buying process. He is an honest real estate agent that will put your concerns first, save you time/money, and share his vast wealth of experience in real estate in greater Pacific Northwest area. I would highly recommend him if you are a first-time home-buyer!"
11193,0.148989898989899,"We recently bought on home in Edmonds and Zach walked us through the process. The whole process was done remotely since we live in a different state. We house-hunted for about 4 months with some discouraging moments. Zach and his team were great throughout. Zach was super-responsive and the whole team was quick to act. He kept things realistic - helping us to put strong offers forward without promising anything. His sense of the market and various circumstances was on point, and we felt we were in good hands all the way through. The remote shopping was tough because we were never able to see any of the houses in person, but Zach's experience in doing video tours and his expertise in assessing the pros and cons of a house made us feel comfortable despite the distance. If we find ourselves buying or selling in the Seattle market again, we will definitely work with Zach again."

He gave me suggestions about what needed to be fixed in the house and he gave me time to get those things done. He prepared a booklet that had all the scenarios on what I could expect to get when I sold the house depending on what I invested to get it ready. He recommended that I stage the house and have professional photos taken and had associates standing by to help when needed. I took all of his suggestions to heart. Jesse listed the house lower than I expected, which worried me a little bit. However, Jesse was spot on with everything. When I fianlly put the house on the market, it sold in 2 days, and there were multiple offers, all more than for what it was listed. Jesse did a fantastic job and I'm thrilled with the results.

Avoid this company at all costs! I had always been a AB faithful customer. I'd used them time and time again in the past, but never again after today. The crew was nice, but I was scammed. I was quoted a 4 hour move from a space that was only 1297 sq feet to a place that was 1650 sq ft. Everything was packed up super nice and wrapped so they didn't have to pack anything. With a 3 man crew, it took them SEVEN hours to move me. I ended up paying $1400 for a move which was more than double the cost I was quoted. They took a break for 45 minutes to an hour and then only took off 15 minutes from the time. They slowed around on purpose toward the end to charge me more. I reached out to a friend that does this kind of work and he confirmed that I has indeed been taken advantage of and been scammed. I even purchased them lunch gift cards as a token of appreciation before they arrived, which made it even more a slap in the face. I was utterly sick. That is an unethical practice and a scam. I will never recommend or use them again. So disappointing.

*Response to your reply

I already reached out and was met with more dishonesty. I was told we could reach a mutual resolution and agreement. But, that did not happen. You all only offered $179 back and said it was your final offer. When asked when I would receive my refund, no date was given. Based on reviews from other customers, the refund is highly unlikely. Utterly disgraceful. What is $179 when a consumer was taken advantage of for over $1400?"

As first time home buyers, we didn't really know what to expect from real estate agents, nor did we expect buying a house in Seattle in 2017 would be as brutal as we had heard. It was bad but Kim and Chavi made it as good as it could possibly be.

Kim, Chavi, Rocky and the rest of Team Diva remained positive and creative, and in the end, we found our perfect home.

Guys were quick to move my stuff out, but took double the time to unload. They didn't take anything g apart.. they didn't wrap anything. They broke my son's bed and a toy.  They put me through hell to get some reimbursement for the bed.  Then they settled the claim with an agreed on amount (that was less than the cost of the bed thus making me pay out of pocket to replace), then backed out and tried to pay me $10 instead. They didn't want to communicate, no one bothered to try and call with questions. They made assumptions and went with them. I had to call numerous times when they should have communicated with me. I will never use these guys again. Very unprofessional and unethical. Just save yourself a headache and use someone else. I wish I had."

Two people loaded the truck in Seattle earlier in the week, but Netzer was by himself for the drive from Seattle and delivery in Spokane Valley ‚Äî toting things on a handcart up three flights of stairs!  (No elevator at the new apartment.) This was after the truck he started out in earlier in the day had issues about an hour out of Seattle and he had to turn around to return to the warehouse there, transfer our son‚Äôs articles to another truck, and restart the five-hour drive. After delivering our son‚Äôs items single-handedly, he had to drive the truck back to Seattle, so he must have arrived well after midnight.  Somehow, he was cheerful and friendly, but that effort seemed superhuman to us.

Bravo Netzer and thank you!"

The moving team (Andy, Esteban, and Jose) worked very hard all day, disassembled and reassembled everything, and did a great job. My only complaint is that the quote changed twice over the course of the day; it ended up being about 35% higher than the quote I had at the beginning of the day. When I originally called, I asked for someone to come out and do an estimate for our office (because I knew we had a lot of stuff), but they told me it was unnecessary. We're a nonprofit, meaning I have to get all expenses pre-approved, so the multiple price increases put me in a bit of a pickle. Other than that, great experience."

Didn't matter what time of day, any day of the week, he was always available to us with an impeccable response time in email and text. His expertise was evident from the get-go as he constantly brought up things to consider as we looked at each house. He had out best interest in mind the entire time and even offered to help us with various house projects if needed. Every time we looked at a house with him, it felt like we were just hanging out with a friend which made the grueling house hunt a little more enjoyable.

2598,0.1424940989326765,"To say that Kyle and his crew saved the day is an understatement. We moved cross country from Wisconsin to Seattle and had a plethora of issues along the way. We hired one moving company once in Seattle to empty our POD (also, don't use PODS!) and they were unprofessional, complained about our stairs and wouldn't even attempt to get our dining room table in the door, citing that, ""it just won't fit."" I called Empty Space Storage to get a small unit and mentioned I needed a mover. She recommended I call Kyle and Easy Company.

HE IS AMAZING. Incredibly kind, professional, empathetic to our rough days and squeezed us in the next day. He and his crew showed up with smiles on and got to work quickly. The truck and all their gear were immaculate and organized, and WOW, do they work hard. They wore masks and were so respectful of space and our home. They not only got the dining room table up the stairs but did so without leaving a single scratch! They were timely and efficient while being sweet and hilarious individuals making the whole lousy week disappear... If it weren't for COVID, I would have hugged each of them repeatedly!

I can't say enough wonderful things about the experience. I have been telling everyone who asks that Easy Company Moving is the only phone call to make. Do NOT waste your time calling any other moving company.

7361,0.1422952380952381,"I am really disappointed to have to write this review because most of my experience was wonderful. 3/4 of our movers were incredibly professional and highly skilled in what they were doing. I was 100% comfortable with the staff until the main mover told me one guys was still being trained and wanted to let me know. Well, throughout the day I had to ask him on numerous occasions to wait for help and to please not drag the furniture on floors. After all this, he still managed to DRAG my wood dresser over the wood floors. The guys were very embarrassed and told me he never should have been on this job this day. Look I understand accidents; like our lamp breaking. BUT to me, this was negligence.

In addition, my daughters crib was not put together properly and the wood was split from the nails being drilled in too much. Therefore, it became very unsafe for my daughter to sleep in her crib. She is 6 months old.

After all of this, I had a conversation with the team and they were beyond apologetic for the day. They knew it went well but that the damages were extensive to my floors. All this, and Daniel (the manager) offered to pay us $348 because of the coverage I signed up for. This wont even cover the floor damages.

The coverage we paid for was for the most professional workers where we could leave our trust in them and things were moved in our home safety. So my advice, if you use Wildcat movers ensure you make sure no one is training and you buy extra coverage because they wont do right by the customer. I would NOT reccomend doing business with Wildcat movers.

I do want to add all the other movers were wonderful. Our disappointed lies from one mover and the customer service after. We are been treated VERY poor."

We ran the washing machine and naturally it flooded our brand new dream home causing about $5,000 in damage from mitigation services to repairs. Their agreement states that they do not cover connecting and disconnecting but this was not a connecting issue. This is simply someone completely did not even put the drain hose into the hole. We filed a claim with them and they declined it citing the part of their agreement where they do not cover water damage."

Then there was the long drive from my first place to my new place, they didn‚Äôt waste any time getting here. Once at the new place, they asked where I wanted everything, cleaned up after the packing material they used, where they wrapped blankets or saran wrap around chest of drawers and so forth to keep my furniture safe. This was probably one of the best moving experiences I have ever had. Thank you guys!!! My quote was accurate, the billing and my charges were exactly what I was told they would be.

While we had all the confidence to succeed, we did lack experience, so we really needed someone that would guide us through the entire process. We found that through Every Door Real Estate. I had absolutely no idea that this process would start so quickly! I thought it'd take a few days to hear back from the company, a few days to hear back from a real estate agent, a few days to attend an appointment, a week or so more to go on our first tour (etc)...but NO! We called the company, and within the first attempt, someone answered right away and connected me to our real estate agent, Emily! We were able to schedule an appointment that same day to go over the entire home buying process, and we got sent our first set of listings within the next few days! Emily was the absolute perfect real estate agent for us. She was on top of everything. Loan officer? She's got it covered. Inspection person? She's got it covered. HOA Reviewer? She's got it covered. It was SO amazing to work with someone who could provide us these resources so we didn't have to do much searching around on our own (and potentially end up with someone that was unsatisfactory). My partner and I are very picky, and instead of getting annoyed or frustrated, she was super understanding! She listened to our wants/needs, but she also taught us how to compromise and choose our first place based on our most important wants. We also appreciate how flexible and understanding she was of our time! Unfortunately, my partner and I have shown up late to a few of our property tours, but she was always ready for us when we got there. You can tell this job is her calling. She's super bubbly, positive, and fun to work with, and she's only a few years older than us, so getting to work with someone close to our age was SUCH a benefit (because she knew exactly how to communicate with us and never talked down to us just because we are super young). This is just the first of many properties we plan on acquiring, and we hope to work with her again (very soon) in the future! I highly recommend this real estate agency for first-time home buyers, and I highly recommend Emily as a real estate agent (especially if you're younger as well)!"

728,0.13902092352092354,"We couldn't be happier with Phoenix Express.

In advance of the move we provided photos of our household to simplify estimation of the needed packing supplies and the labor intensity.

The packing crew showed up on time, had absolutely every tool and packing supply ready to go, and worked at blazing speed. Our household items were packed compactly, safely, and securely. The ladies were upbeat, cheerful, and clearly expert in their field. Or boxes were labeled distinctly and clearly, making unpacking a breeze. Not a single item was damaged in transit - not even the more delicate decor pieces. When the packing job was completed - and it took about 75% less time that the two of us would have needed - the ladies provided a clear summary of the material and labor costs. The sent box count to the moving crew, who would arrive the next morning.

The next morning the moving team arrived - 15 minutes early! They texted me in advance so we could meet them by the loading dock of our building. Supplies had been pre-prepared, dropped off by our apartment earlier in that morning - this crew SERIOUSLY has the routine down pat. You can just tell from the workers' friendliness and efficiency that they had their protocols planned out and they strived to be in and out as soon as possible. Just like the packing team, every member politely introduced him/herself, then hustled to help everyone else to get the job done. The loading took maybe 90 minutes for a 2BR apartment. (If I had done it with my friends, it would take us a day.)

Our garage fob-keycard accidently left with a crewmember. One of the owners made it a point to drive it back in twenty minutes.

Throughout the transit to Denver, the owners kept us informed of the haul's progress. It's such a relief to not have your home simply disappear into a black hole of semis and trucks.

Here comes the kicker - the trucks arrived ready to deliver a full day early! We couldn't take advantage of the opportunity, sadly, as our lease started the next day. The owners used the extra time to scout out where they would need to park the truck next morning and they spoke with the building's director to pre-plan the unloading.

When we arrived in our new place, Jeff and Beau had already off-loaded some of the boxes and had them ready by the loading dock! They carefully unloaded our furniture, boxes, and art in a matter of hours. We couldn't be happier with the process.

Angie followed up with us to make sure nothing was damaged and provided a detailed, finalized invoice. We only had a couple of minor breakages and scrapes - nothing that in hindsight was avoidable. Still, Phoenix Express quickly issued an appropriate credit to make sure we're 100% satisfied.

And we certainly are that! This genuine group of people cares about their reputation, knows what they're doing, owns the process end-to-end, and follow up to make sure their clients are satisfied. Next time we move, we won't even consider anyone else. (One rarely hears such praise about a moving company!)"

I have no idea how many other people he‚Äôs helped in the past 5 years but him keeping my number and remembering my wife and I just further exemplifies the amazing, personal service you get with Tod. As before, he came out within a few days to take beautiful, professional photos of the house and walked me through all the steps of the selling process with patience and detail. With his thorough market analysis and pricing strategy, we were able to sell our home after just one weekend of showings. Tod handled all the negotiations as always and got us everything we wanted in a buyer. As always, the best part of his amazing service is that he does it for a fraction of the cost any other agent would charge, no strings attached. I Zelled him $595 at listing and the other $595 was taken out at closing‚Ä¶Even our title agent thought it was a mistake!  Thanks to Tod, we kept an extra $14,050 of our own money to put toward our next home. Stop paying all your hard earned equity to agents who still take a percentage‚Ä¶ especially in this market!!!

He tried to charge me $350+ on top of the $100 deposit I paid to hold my reservation.

He said $89 an hour, MINIMUM 2 hours.
My move was 2 1/2 hours.
2 1/2 hours is $222.50 minus the $100 deposit is $122.50.

I paid $123 in cash AND gave the movers $100 tips.

The owner called me and said that he was going to charge my card the additional $350 for not paying him what was owed. His guys literally were sitting outside my door and wouldn‚Äôt leave because the owner was telling them he was going to take it out of their check unless I paid the $350+

10387,0.13714539007092202,"I highly recommend Trelora for sellers. I was considering going the FSBO route and discovered Trelora online. We had owned our home for almost 20 years and were highly prepared to sell, having conducted a pre-listing inspection and spending three months readying the home for sale. Trelora entered the Seattle market in January 2018. When we contacted them in April 2018, they were highly responsive and sent a field contact out to meet my wife and I within 24 hours of contacting them. The field contact made a cursory review of our property and then spent plenty of time outlining Trelora's services and answering our questions. I asked to  meet face-to-face with the primary representative (Rod), and he was immediately receptive. Trelora handles listing your home on multiple online services and all documents necessary for the sale. They provide a sign and lockbox. They are obviously working on a high-volume, low-margin basis so they are relying on buyers' agents to do the heavy lifting of showing the property. They initially ""discouraged"" an open house as ineffective, but they were open to investing the time to do this if our home didn't sell in the first two weeks. They handle most of the details of selling a home that a traditional listing agent would complete but for a flat fee. E.g., all negotiations with buyer's agents go through Trelora; you don't have to ever speak to a buyer's agent. All appoinments and showings go through Trelora; you don't have to manage those appointments. Same with inspections and other closing details. You only pay them 20% of their flat fee to start and pay the other 80% at time of sale. You can terminate the relationship and agreement at any time. Rod was available via text, email, and phone at all times needed during the process, and he provided excellent advice to price our home in the sweet spot. Rod patiently answered every question my spouse and I had, and he walked us through the process thoroughly. We sold our home in six days after listing and received 99% of listing price. Many homes around us have been on market for 30 or more days and are starting to reduce their list price. I give Trelora four stars because 1) their attention to detail sometimes lacked, making some mistakes in the multiple listing that were caught by my spouse and me; 2) their comparative pricing tools are rudimentary and can easily be replicated using online information (but Rod's strategic pricing advice looking at available data was highly valuable); and 3) Trelora's free photo service produced low quality photos that would not have showcased our home adequately. (We ended up hiring a photographer ourselves for $400 that took high-quality professional photos.) In total, we paid Trelora $2,500 (their flat fee) and 2% to the buyer's agent, a savings of almost $30k in commissions (You can offer the buyer's agent whatever you decide, but Rod gave some really good advice on various options, never insisting on one path or the other, just providing sound advice.). I highly recommend working with them. The real estate industry deserves and needs serious disruption; Trelora is one step to making that occur. You have little to lose in the long run, why not spend $500 to explore whether this can work for you?"

7299,0.13693576388888887,"So, we've used Eco twice, to move my elderly mom first to assisted living and then to memory care. The first move went fine, the second not so much. Now, this 'google' review only offers 4 'buttons' so I selected ""not professional"" and ""poor quality"" because of the struggle and damage to furniture. Otherwise they were nice, friendly, accommodating and communicate well. But ultimately, it's about the move and furnishings.

So, The single greatest and easiest example is they had to move a Sofa, first out of the apartment and then into the house. It's a La-z-boy sofa, with built in recliners on each end. So.....

They struggle to get this out of the apartment, then inside the house front door, having to set it down a few times, twist turn, somewhere in the process, they drug the top corner of the couch and it rubbed right thru the fabric, leaving a hole about the size of a quarter, but in plain, everyday sight! Ugh!

Now, I recently moved the couch to have carpets cleaned and discovered..... the backs come completely off! There are release levers and boom, backs off, couch is lighter, smaller and skinnier so getting in/out is easy.  I would think that ""Professional"" movers would be aware of such potential knowledge?? Neither the first or second crew, btw, thought or considered this. So, that's a huge strike. They also damaged a Grandfather clock, but not 100% their fault."

11425,0.13410621365166822,"I‚Äôm an active veteran and I have awesome benefits available to me. I learned with Geoff that there are still fees associated with buying a home even for veterans aside from the benefits and no money down purchases that lots of companies and people don‚Äôt tell you up front, such as taxes, insurance, interest rate and lender fees and more. Geoff Fahey and his team educated me on the entire process and helped take things off my plate.

He not only got me over $16,000 to pay ALL my fees, which is more than most ever get and unheard of for a home in the $300,000 price range, including for any new construction and new developments builder incentives promise you (which typically have extra fees and higher costs like I noticed on my first property)‚Ä¶this money helped me pay much less on my monthly payment with a lower rate. He also got all my deposit money back even after the seller and listing agent were difficult to work with and incorrectly disclosed info to us early on. He negotiated to get about $5,000 in repairs made to the home, and got my ENTIRE deposit back. Wow. Unheard of and incredible. Will use Geoff again. Word of caution. Don‚Äôt buy yourself no matter what.

If you‚Äôre in Florida or North Carolina or looking into investing in properties and making money with a house, call Geoff. Do NOT go to listing agent, or seller, or for sale by owner, or builder directly. You do NOT save money. Look what would have happened above. I never would have known they were not disclosing accurate info if wasn‚Äôt¬†¬†for Geoff. Seller and listing agent and builder work for the seller. They have a signed financial contract with each other. They can NOT also give you a good deal. It‚Äôs illegal to represent both parties in Florida despite what you may have heard. Have Geoff work for you, your interests, and help you make money investing in real estate."
494,0.1340909090909091,Austyn and Wesley helped us move and were really efficient and productive. They even rolled out a red carpet in your new place. Thanks for the easiest move I‚Äôve had in my life.

This was the 2nd time we've used Wildcat Movers and would use them again and recomend to anyone else.
3146,0.1340277777777778,"I was out in Texas visiting parents when they decided that they wanted to make a short move. They lived in a complex with no elevator and lots of stairs. Generally, when this type of situation arises I enlist a few friends and get it done. However, being a thousand of miles away from my own home that wasn‚Äôt an option. So, I started searching and happened upon Wildcat Movers.

The reason I initially chose Wildcat Movers was the amount of time that they have been active. It is always a good sign when a company can maintain a business for an extended amount of time. Once I called I was completely sold. For one, the pricing is simple and straight forward. It is simply charged by the hour. No up-charges for carrying TVs or any BS like that. Plus the insurance is included within the price. There are no surprise fees.

When the day came Daniel and Jacob were on time and responsive to communication. They were very friendly, professional, and efficient. They always made sure everything was done to our liking. This was a hard move and they did amazing. There was no way that I could have got this done with out them. My parents will be moving again soon and Wildcat Movers will definitely be getting a call then as well."

Guy found us a place which matches our budget and he went above and beyond to let us move in just 4 days!! Guy is our life saver. He is very professional and a nice person. He replies quick and will never let you down. He is definitely a great asset to his company. Thanks again, Guy!"
5282,0.13349647266313933,"Darius, Andre and Eric were more than a company coming in and moving stuff around. They took care of our things and of us throughout the day. My wife and I spent the week boxing everything up, but these guys went beyond and wrapped, protected, cushioned and cared for our furniture and giant 75‚Äù tv so well, we never flinched a single time all day. They were also very courteous and provided an atmosphere as if they were instantly family the moment they walked in. Don‚Äôt get me wrong though, they were not sitting around just chatting, they were moving very efficiently and happily all day (finished early even)!
Our apartment we moved into required a $300 fee to use the elevator for move in days which we paid and we still had a few neighbors behave so incredibly rude and mean to the Ecomover crew and seeing how professional, polite and diffusing the Eco crew was really left a mark on me I won‚Äôt soon forget. You could tell these men from Ecomovers were more professional than most empty suits could dream of ever being. In terms of price value: with these kinds of things, the quality of worker cannot be overlooked. Ecomovers was by no means more expensive. It was actually within $100 of the three companies I contacted. Ecomovers had the most thorough and responsive admin though so we went with them and the actual crew was nothing but the best and top of the line professionals who took their jobs seriously. Thank you, Darius, Andre and Eric!"

They left the empty plastic rolls just on the floor in my apartment, bumped and messed up so many corners that I‚Äôll have to pay for. My bar stools have cracks in them. Would I use them again, absolutely NOT. Not for what I paid and then to have to come and pay my Apartments for damages that were cause on the doors from the move."

Every day after contacting them, they spammed me with text messages, phone calls, and emails. Sometimes multiple times in one day! Maybe they do a good job, but I don't recommend them because of poor business practices."

11247,0.13277243589743587,"We contacted Geoff a whole three days (sarcasm) before offers were due on a house we truly fell in love with. At the time, my husband and I had only been casually looking and didn't find anything we felt was worth the effort to put an offer on, until low and behold we happened upon the ""blue house."" It was a Sunday afternoon that we saw her, and knew we had to do something. We then found Geoff on Monday afternoon and offers were due that Thursday morning! My first question to him was ""is this even possible given the amount of time that we have?"" I think his response was something along the lines of ""anything is possible, but here's what we need to do."" We weren't newbies to bidding wars and pre-approvals as we had lost several battles and took a break from house hunting for a few years. However, those previous events served as good practice so that we were able to act quickly getting all the needed information, while Geoff skillfully guided us through the process. He knows his stuff, was quick to get everything in order, and always responded very quickly to any of our questions. That Thursday was one heck of a roller-coaster ride as we weren't sure which way things were going to go, but following Geoff's advice indeed made our offer the strongest and we prevailed! He also proved to be true to his word when we did hit a snag, and for being trustworthy he deserves the highest of ratings. I wouldn't look any further for a realtor and if I ever am in the market again I won‚Äôt hesitate to work with Geoff."

7259,0.13266666666666668,Great service and very professional staff. They were extremely careful with all the furniture.

He has been patient with us with our search which initially started with the entire west and east side of the lake. He would show us our selected houses within a few days of our search.

Rob was able to get us our almost dream house at a slightly lower bid compared to the other bid on the house. After the offer got accepted, the process of closing went smoothly as well and we were able to close on time."

11039,0.1324540043290043,"My experience with TRELORA was hands down the BEST customer service experience I have EVER had in any transaction I have EVER made EVER!! EVER!!!

We bought a house and sold a house at the same time with TRELORA. If you have ever done this you know how stressful it can be.

I was warned by many people in the real estate industry that TRELORA was some fly by night discount company that was not going to make it and I was going to receive second rate service and there is no way they can provide quality service at the prices they are charging......blah blah blah. I am telling you these warnings were WRONG!! My TRELORA team was phenomenal every step of the way and on every level! I never went a single day without being updated on the sale of my house and the purchase of my future home. Multiple times during our process there were things that I was asked to give on that I thought were no big deal and they negotiated  in my favor successfully every time.

In the end I sold my house for $15,000 over list price and saved $13,500 in commissions. Bought my future home for $12,000 under the original contract price and received $5,000 back in commission savings!!

Seriously I cant stress it enough if you're looking for real estate representation look no further these guys will not let you down!"
797,0.13235294117647062,"If you don't use Tod Franklin and DFW Cityhomes you are literally throwing thousands of dollars away. I have to admit that I was skeptical of their pricing being so low. How could one real estate agency charge 3% of the selling price to list our home ($18,000) while DFWCityhomes charges less than $2,000?  Well here's the difference ...... Tod did everything a listing real estate agent would do except actually show the home in person. He came and discussed pricing strategies, did comps of houses like ours in our area, took amazing photos and listed us on MLS .... just like the real estate agents that charge 3%!  The only difference is that instead of having your agent make appointments to meet prospective buyers at your property, DFWCityhomes uses a service that contacts you by text or email to advise you when someone wants to view your home and you can either be there or not as DFWCityhomes provides you with a lockbox so other agents can access your home for approved appointments. Also, you get to determine what times and days you will make your property available and when it isn't.  It was so easy! We sold our house for OVER asking price to the first prospective buyer. Tod took care of all of the paperwork and answered all our questions and concerns and was critical in making sure the deal closed.
I will NEVER pay 3% again, and neither should you."

For opportunities to invest your cash and build a portfolio of STRONG income producing properties so you can retire early, and provide significant passive income and wealth for your family for years to come, contact Geoff ASAP. Geoff and his team often have access to homes not yet on the internet that most of the public and other agents don‚Äôt even know about, because they do significantly more volume with hundreds of families and investors they‚Äôve helped vs the average agent that‚Äôs only sold a few homes.

They had a long distance from my door to their truck at the first location but I never heard them complained and they worked fast.

The reason for the one star missing is because I'm missing some boxes and I'm pretty sure they must have put them in my storage unit when I had all of the boxes marked.

Also, they put all of the boxes in my kitchen or living area and I had to move the other boxes to my bedroom and bathroom. Besides that, it was a good experience. Thank you!"

He also furnished the leasing office with my information to streamline the process.  He was extremely helpful and approached every leasing management as a professional realtor representing on my behalf.  He remained unbiased to every apartment complex and focused only my specs.  Although it is his job to search for apartments, he exhibited great enthusiasm and determination to find the right one for me.  Above all, he did no exert any pressure and allowed time for vacillation among the many choices that lied before me.  At the end of the day, I chose a brand new apartment complex that embodied my main specifications.  I move in 9/1/2012 and am extremely excited.  I highly recommend Jake Swinney!"

We were first-time homebuyers and new to everything, and he guided us through the complicated process well, from the very quick purchase process to the financing, and then the long march to closing. And when our escrow company gave the various utility companies the wrong occupancy date, resulting in us paying for service before we started living in the new house, Doron worked with us to deal with the issue, and ultimately paid us the difference out of his own pocket. This demonstrates the level of care and commitment he takes in his partnership with you.

In summary, he is very communicative and responsive and knows his business, industry, and the local market and trends well! We highly recommend working with him."

Without fail, and without prompting, he made sure to continue to follow through on the job, while we went back to Pennsylvania, until the deal was done.  We ran into a few snags (on the other broker's end) and Chris did more than was asked or expected to make sure our interests were looked after.  His communication was clear, his work ethic unmatched, and his knowledge of the business unquestionable.  If you are looking for an agent that will be sure to listen to you and work hard for you, then Chris Vierthaler is the person to contact!"

372,0.12657342657342657,"Stay away.

During our move - while hourly rate was running - they made me sign a document which basically let them off the hook regarding any damages caused to my belonging. When I asked about the document - before signing - they told me that it applies to furniture which have some existing damages.

Afterwards, when new damages were exposed, they claimed that the document I initiated is a ""get outta jail"" card - regarding any damages on any furniture (old or new).

i.e. See image of what they did to our ~$700 kitchen table top.

After several calls with AM Moving Company's representatives, and once proven that it was their movers who caused these NEW damages, they promised to compensate damages using their weight-based insurance system. But once I provided the total weight of the damaged furniture - AM Moving Company withdraw from the promised compensation, and declined to compensate anything.

I'd rather break my own furniture than pay for AM Moving Company to do so.

9/25/2018: To reply on the response received:
a) We were NOT moving from storage unit, it was an ~2,000 sqf apartment.
b) Trust me, all of my belongings were NOT damaged. Some were, and those damages are documented in a separate report created by insurance company earlier. None of the furniture that AM Moving Company damaged are listed in that report. This was also explained to AM Moving company representatives. To this they had NO response.
c) AM Moving Company documented existing damages during packaging, but when asked to provide pictures of these new damages afterwards, they didn't have any - go figure.
d) Document that AM Company's movers made me sign / initial, was not clarified, and it goes beyond belief that a such document exists - one which let's a moving company to treat customer's belongings without any liability. When I signed, I was given an impression that we have agreed, and documented (via pictures), which furniture has existing damages. -NOT THAT IT APPLIES TO EVERY (~5,000) ITEM WHICH WAS MOVED."
5533,0.12651104063894764,"I chose Eco Movers for a local move because I did not want to have a lot of waste of paper boxes. The move went fine and ultimately everything was moved without any major mishaps, but I can't say I was impressed with the moving day experience.

My biggest complaint is that the movers wore their shoes inside my house on my carpet even after I asked them not to. Every other professional I have had come into my house for any reason has put shoe covers on. They put down a carpet but it didn't extend into the bedrooms, so they just walked around with their shoes on my brand new carpet.

I also paid for eco boxes but they didn't come with zip ties or any way to seal them. (For my last move, I ordered Frog Boxes and they came with zip ties). This was annoying but ultimately everything arrived and it seems sealing the boxes wasn't necessary, though I would have felt more comfortable with them sealed.

Finally, the move cost $1000 more than quoted. They claimed it took longer than expected to pack up our kitchen stuff. But seeing how fast they got everything loaded into the truck in the first 30 minutes, I was very surprised it took as long as it did. It took them about 4 hours to pack 9 boxes total. And some of those boxes were just filled with plastic bowls that didn't have to be wrapped up.

I normally would have been present to oversee the move, but because of covid concerns, we left while they were packing the house. So I can't say for sure what took them so long but I don't think there was anything about my kitchen that should have taken longer than expected. I would have expected a more accurate quote and more timely work from the movers. They seemed to be outside smoking quite a bit.

And on top of all that, they don't even use eco boxes -- they used cardboard boxes! So I still had a ton of waste to get rid of.

My experience was pretty medicore. I did like using the eco boxes myself, and I'd recommend them for that reason. All the scheduling and communication was really good leading up to the move. But if you choose them, I would recommend you be present during the move and carefully oversee what is happening."
6869,0.12640211640211643,"I came across Zach first on youtube. He has several informational videos which are very helpful for a beginner and he publishes monthly updates on current market trends. After following him for a few years, I decided to take a plunge and look for a home for my growing family.
His approach was quite methodical where he asked questions which helped us narrow down on what we want. Then he showed us matching homes, explained pros & cons of those and guided us on several things to look for that we were not aware of. Market was really hot and we couldn't even put offer on 3-4 homes that we liked and they were gone. Ultimately, we were able to find a home that we liked and Zach helped us to put together a competitive offer (not a crazy one but just like 17k over asked price but relaxing other terms without taking any unreasonable risk) which we won and moved into our dream home in under two months.
Thanks Zach. Really appreciate your help.
Anyone reading this review, I would highly recommend Zach. Please do subscribe to his youtube channel and don't miss those very informative videos."

They sent me two young boys. 1 boy had 3 months experience and the other one had 4 months experience.  The day of the move the movers broke my grandfather clock. Both boys admitted that they did not have any experience moving a grandfather clock. WHY would you sent Two inexperienced boys when you were aware that one item was a grandfather clock. WHY did you not send at least 1 experienced person with these boys. The boys apologized but that does not  make the situation better. My grandfather clock is still broken. I feel the company was negligent because they were aware of what needed to be moved right from the beginning.

With in minutes of contacting two listings, I got contacted by two different agents but one was more immediate with meeting us. That evening we met Angela Crea. She took the time to sit down and explain to us the process of purchasing a home and answered all the question we had. Angela had us view  three different homes in the area to get a feel for what we were interested in. We ran into the second real estate agent that contacted us on our way out of the last property. He offered to open the door and show us around but we already told him that we already looked around. Just from her assertiveness and the competitive vibe we got from our initial meet, we knew Angela would be a good ally to have in navigating the home buyers market to finding our perfect home. Her vast knowledge of the Seattle area and her response to any and all questions and concerns we had were addressed in a timely manner. Her flexibility with our schedule made it easy for us to average 8 private home viewing a week, narrowing our choices down very quickly. During the closing period we were both very impressed with how Angela was able to oversee and  handle a difficult transition of ownership from a very difficult homeowner and a loan branch manager that was not honest with his progress and was difficult to contact. In the end we were both very satisfied with Angela's performance and we would definitely recommend her to our friends and family!!"

1) I was very impressed by his knowledge and willingness to point out trade offs for potential homes. There were many times he pointed out positive or negative aspects of a home during a tour that we did not notice, several times being a deciding factor to continue looking for other homes. Even so, he never took an approach that was pushy, only informative.
2) He was always available, even at times I did not even expect a response.
3) he helped at every stage of the process from looking at homes to making a to-do schedule for closing actions, and his responsiveness never wavered.

Also be aware--if a Redfin realtor tells you to check out all their reviews on the Redfin site, know that they only let you review if they're successful in completing a transaction. We were listed with Redfin for 3 months with not even a bite while comps sold around us, and we were not given the opportunity to review our realtor."

Months later, we gave up with them and hired Picket Street.  We didn't know what hit us!  Jesse was not only immediately responsive and actively involved, he brought an entire team of immediately-responsive professionals who brought with them proven tools to move us toward selling our home.  Within a week and a half, our house was rebranded and ready to sell.  To get us there, Jesse did his homework, thoroughly educated us, moved with intention and speed, and got the job done.  We had a solid full-price offer after the first weekend!  Jesse was completely present and wonderfully communicative throughout the entire process.  We couldn't be happier and we highly recommend Jesse and the entire Pickett Street team.  They are what everyone hopes their realty team will be.  We are extremely grateful."

Norman and Oscar did a great job moving all of my furniture from a one bedroom apartment to my new townhome. I especially appreciate all of the obstacles they were able to work around, like finding parking on narrow streets, assembling/reassembling furniture, and moving considerably heavy pieces across countless flights of stairs. And the price was very reasonable. All in all, it was a job well done."

They were thorough and fast. Another great experience. I know I will use them for the next move.

He helped us not only find our first home but break the lease at our apartment. Making the decision to buy your first home is very scary especially here in the volatile Seattle market. The entire process has been smooth and we genuinely feel like we were in the right hands and taking care of! We wouldn‚Äôt have wanted it to go down any other way.

10724,0.12391304347826085,"We were introduced to Geoff by satisfied clients last year. We learned why. The Seattle market covers quite an area, though our focus was quite narrow - West Seattle, southwest of downtown - and though Geoff lives north of downtown, at least 45‚Äù away, he had a good of where value was from Alki/Admiral to Arroyo Heights, too (and more importantly, wasn‚Äôt). On more than one occasion he was able to drop other commitments and help us with remote viewing via video walkthroughs (when away from Seattle, we were in Europe)  and organizing of pre-purchase inspections; in one case, on only only a few hours notice precipitated by a curious bidding deadline - a Sunday evening (?!), for a property we had only happened by during a Saturday open house. On more than one occasion, he was able to glean seller intentions via their brokers, and during the negotiations for our ultimate purchase, sage advice on both outright bidding strategy and when to force the seller to accept his notional target was fanciful, for at least us as buyers. All this was in the context of an uneven market where any degree of consistency was rarely the norm."

12012,0.1235557053009883,"Buying or Selling a house is a HUGE milestone in life and definitely not something to take lightly. That being said, the very prospect of starting this process can be exciting but at the same time, very overwhelming and full of doubts, even for those whom consider themselves reasonably knowledgeable, like myself.

When my husband told me a few months ago that we would need to relocate because of his job, I knew I would be the one handling the sale of our house and started working on it right away. Since we hadn‚Äôt own our property for long, actually less than 2 years, I knew I would have to look for the best way to take advantage of the favorable market while trying to save as much as possible in closing costs if I wanted to secure any equity from the sale. So I decided to look into options like Sale by owner or Flat Fee MLS listings.
To be completely honest, my initial research was extremely disappointing. The websites that offered this kind of service were very outdated and lacking detailed information. Their terms were also ‚Äúshady‚Äù with hidden fees and conditions that didn‚Äôt really favor the prospect clients on the long run. I definitely wanted to save on the realtor commission, but not at the cost of compromising on the quality and exposure of my listing which seemed like an impossible task at first. That was until I found Richr.

I remember that my first reaction to Richr was one of incredulity. After seeing all the other options out there, I couldn‚Äôt avoid the the though that they seemed way too good to be true but I am beyond grateful that after digging deeper, I felt confident enough to reach out to them on the very next day. The rest is history.

After my very first call to their office, It took less than 48hrs for our house to be listed in the MLS and multiple outlets. In less than a week, the sale was under contract.

Serena and her team were impeccable at every single detail. From first contact until our closing day, I felt they had my back. Their customer service is out of this world and their professionalism is unquestionably praiseworthy. I have never been this pleased with any other service before and it‚Äôs quite unbelievable that on top of everything they helped us save almost $13k in closing costs!

I am a fan for life of Richr and all the services that they offer. We used their listing service and also their title company as our closing agents. I would recommend to anyone and everyone to do the same if they have the chance to. You won‚Äôt be disappointed!"

He and the Jennifer Kenna home selling team eliminated so much work, thinking and stress off of my plate. I am someone who can ask a million questions a day, and Geoff answers all of them.

He then coordinated everything from photographing the home to facilitating repairs.  While the home was listed (and prior to being under contract), Geoff provided detailed market insight related to sales in the area so that we could have a sense of what to expect in terms of offers and timing.

8592,0.12192090317090319,"We just finished moving yesterday and we couldn‚Äôt be more pleased. From the beginning contacting Pure Moving to the end, the experience was painless. I was connected to Austin ( who I think based in California).  He was fast, responsive and flexible. He was able to work around our busy schedules from estimating ( which I sent a video instead of zoom bc of bad service at the old place), to booking and changing moving dates. He definitely kept us in the loop of the process

Moving day: team leader texted they were on route. They came 10 mins earlier than scheduled ( which I appreciate more than being late). We did a general walk through to ensure what should go and what should stay. They started packing and it was supper quick! We had a pleasure to work with Daniel ( team leader), Dima, Vitally and Pavel. They wrapped all of our furnitures carefully and quickly. We did throw a few curveballs along the way but they made it happened with no complaints, just positive attitudes! From team leader to helpers everyone did their part. They worked together very well ! They communicated well with each other ( to make sure stuff were moved without damage) and everyone pulled their weight ( literally!). They worked from 9am-8pm, with very little breaks ( if at all ) at lunch which we were happy to provide some food. No one sat down just for a minute, they were always on their feet moving stuff. And! They cleaned up after themselves after the move.

Some of the examples: they wrapped our couches in blankets and shrink wraps ( not a scratch!) , carefully wrapped and moved our upright piano, even last minute change on a glass tv console from 1st to 2nd floor with tight staircase! Nothing broke, nothing scratched

This is the first moving company we worked with that gave us such a positive experience. We will be moving again in the future ( as this current place is a rental) and I will sure move with Pure Moving again. Personal thanks to Daniel, Dima, Vitally, Pavel again !

10033,0.1209879406307978,"We started working with Danny to purchase a home in late 2014/early 2015. He was amazing. The housing market was booming and extremely competitive and we had a limited budget. Danny began sending me new listings daily (on the same day they were posted) that fit our criteria and was always available for showings, sometimes on that same day. Danny was ready to pounce when we were, knowing that timing could be our one advantage with our limited budget. Unfortunately, the market was a little more competitive than we were ready for. After losing a couple of bidding wars (due to our limited budget, not Danny's efforts), we decided to take a break from looking for a few months. Danny understood and kept in touch, but without pressuring us to begin our search again before we were ready.

We loved working with Danny so much before, that when we were ready to start looking again, we knew we wanted to work with him. After more searching and what seemed like a million open houses, we found a foreclosure that was owned by Fannie Mae with amazing potential. As first-time home buyers, a foreclosure made us nervous. We didn't know what red flags to look for, what to offer, how to counter, etc. Danny helped us through it, answered all of my stereotypically na√Øve, first-time home buyer questions. We felt very informed and comfortable throughout the whole process.

With Danny's help, we were successful in purchasing that home and have been living there for 6 months. Danny still keeps in touch and just recently congratulated us on the 6 month anniversary of home ownership (he even asked about our dogs!). I will recommend Danny to anyone looking to purchase a home, especially first-time home buyers."

It ended up taking 5 hours for only a 2 bedroom house without even reassembling furniture at the new house. On top of everything else they damaged my dining room table set in 6 different places.

If the bidding got really high, he would make it clear if he didn't think it was worth it, but supported us if we still decided to move forward. Rob is also very knowledgable when it comes to home renovations and approximating how big or small a project is, which factored into our decision making many times.

He made sure everything was taken  care of and even though it was confusing to us, he talked us through it, never getting frustrated with our questions or pestering near the end. I have and will continue to recommend Geoff.

Selling: Geoff was our broker when we bought our home as a short-sale in 2013 and also when we sold the home this past October. We've worked with him a total of about 9 months with the purchase and sale and I can confidently say I would not have wanted to deal with any other agents (I had worked with a few shady types before we found Geoff). Geoff's communication is extremely solid and he has no issues explaining the process of the deal and keeping you informed. He is very knowledgeable in his profession and it shows. Just look at his sales history. He's a monster in the best possible way. If you are buying or selling your house, Geoff is the person you want in your corner. I can honestly say that I would have zero issues sending any of my friends and family to Geoff if they were looking to buy real estate in the Seattle Area. He seems to be as good of a person as he is a broker. Geoff is at the top of his game and you would be a fool not to want to work with him. We will be back with him when we buy our next house, too. Also, he doesn't just forget about you when your contract is signed. Each year we‚Äôve gotten a Christmas card and a candle, handmade by Geoff himself. Super cool in my opinion. THANKS GEOFF!"
9697,0.11857284580498868,"After a previous negative experience with another local moving company during our last move, we were shopping around for movers who would handle our furniture with care and had experience moving around the multiple stairs and tight corners of our previous and current North Queen Anne townhouses. The two townhouses were so nearby to each other that most furniture needed to be wheeled or carried a block rather than loaded into a truck and driven, and our three person team ‚Äî Boni G., Julio G., and Allan ‚Äî were professional and friendly as they wrapped and moved our large furniture with care. They clearly all worked well as a team, and asked us questions about placement and how to best navigate the house but required very little direction behind that. One note is that they may not have brought enough runners to protect the interior floors, so inevitably some outdoor shoes got dirt around. But after a quick vacuum, there was no damage done by the team to the house or furniture despite the challenging tight stairways of both houses.

We also need to give a shout-out to Daryl, who was our primary contact when we were calling around various moving companies for quotes. He was by far the most friendly, empathetic, and personable of all the people we talked to, and that ultimately sold us to go with Eco Movers in the first place. We had multiple calls as our quote developed (due to items being removed and added to our list,) and we were pleasantly surprised that he negotiated a competitive rate for us due to the uniqueness of our move.

All in all the service felt worth the price ‚Äî from the moment Daryl first picked up the phone, all the way to when the team was packed up and paid. We will no doubt love to work with Eco Movers again when the time comes, and until then we are happy to finally feel at home thanks to the furniture they took such care in delivering."

1175,0.11683261183261184,"I picked Eco Movers because of the great reviews online plus several of my real estate colleagues recommended them (among a couple of other firms). The salesperson who did the quote was great and very knowledgeable, but unfortunately, the crew they sent had a lot of very inexperienced folks. It was a 2 day move from Woodinville to Kingston. Day 1, they had an experienced lead who told the others to protect the hardwood flooring. But unfortunately, while he was wrapping up some large items in the family room, the rest of the crew loaded up the boxes in the garage. Problem is that they put heavy boxes on top of boxes containing fragile stuff.  About 10 of our boxes looked like they have been through the war after they arrived at the new home. A standing mirror's legs got broken. Several of my Riedel glasses and a vase were broken.  Probably there would be more casualties if I weren't an experienced packer.  I'm not as upset with those items, but they didn't protect the stairwell at all when they moved our sectional upstairs. The walls at the stairwell got quite a few gashes, bumps and dings which will need to be repaired.
Eco Movers did give me a discount for day 2, and I tipped the movers anyway because they worked hard. But I am far from pleased with the move."

The office staff and crew addressed any concerns we had, were accommodating, proficient, and very polite the entire duration. My initial reaction when I booked the move was that I thought the estimate was a little high compared to other movers I call. I have had bad moving experiences in the past, and from my perspective, paying a little extra to ensure you get a quality job from a professional company was well worth the additional cost. Not to mention the move came in under estimated quote. Highly recommend Eco Movers!!"

I came to appreciate several qualities of Danny as my realtor.  1) He was always responsive.  If I emailed, or called, he was very prompt to answer/return correspondence and was thorough in his response.  2) He has an in depth knowledge of the market.  There were houses I would think about making an offer on and his sense for what it would take to be the winning bid was always spot on. He flat out knows where the market is, how its moving, and lets his clients know hos to navigate each situation.  3) He has a calm demeanor.  Buying a house can be hectic and stressful.  The last thing you want is a realtor who adds to that stress or anxiety.  Danny definitely did not.  He was calm, measured and relaxed.  Even when deadlines were tight he never wavered.

Based on these characteristics, I would recommend his to anyone.  When it comes time to buy/sell again, he will be the first person I call."

I must start by saying the company gave me a 25% refund for the issues. The movers took an hour to drive 0.5 mile to my new place and billed me for the full hour.

2509,0.11297898338220919,"I called AB Moving on 4.29.20 to get a quote for my move from Austin to Dallas, TX. I told Mike that I wanted a better rate than my last move, but the same order - I wanted to be packed into boxes, loaded on the truck in Austin and unloaded in Dallas. Clearly ambitious to land the sale, Mike said he could best my previous rate by $100. So I booked it.
On the 18th at 8:15am, only two movers showed up: Mo and Javier. Only two because Mike had completely botched my order. The movers weren‚Äôt prepared to pack my things into boxes. They called customer service to hear playback of the original call and it was found that indeed AB Moving had dropped the ball for the 1st time. At this point, the two movers left to get packing materials and didn‚Äôt arrive back until 10:15am.
Because I needed to pick up keys for my new place in Dallas before the leasing office closed, and because there were only 2 movers left to pack up a 1600 sqft home, I expressed my concern about timing to Mo. He said, ‚Äúyou can go ahead; we‚Äôll take care of everything‚Äù. I believed him. He seemed honest and helpful. However, in my experience there always has to be one level-headed foreman to oversee the rest of the usually far less reliable crew ‚Äì in this case, Javier.
Before I left my place in Austin around 2:30pm with the movers still packing, I went over in detail all of the things I wanted them to be sure to box up. Mo confirmed, I left. Though they projected an ETA of 7:30pm, they didn‚Äôt arrive in Dallas until midnight and didn‚Äôt finish unloading until 2am ‚Äì amounting to AB Moving dropping the ball for the 2nd time. It should be noted that I tried to duly compensate the movers for their efforts and hard work; I knew the onus wasn‚Äôt entirely upon their shoulders. I tipped them $300.
The following morning, I realized they had left about $300 worth of vitamins in my fridge. They had also forgotten furniture, they didn‚Äôt pack ANY of the medicine in my medicine cabinet, nor did they get the mounts or custom paints that were in the garage - AB Moving dropped the ball for the 3rd time.
About 5d later they made a second trip and came back with most of these items but still left several. This would qualify as the 4th time AB Moving dropped the ball.
While unpacking I discovered that my coffee table was irreparably damaged, my Samsung TV hub was scratched, a wine glass was broken, my Kitchen Aid mixer was packed on its side directly on top of my Cuisinart toaster oven so that not only motor oil leaked from my mixer onto all the other items in the box, but the top of my toaster oven was dented so the door would not properly close ‚Äì it cost me $87.99 to replace. But most upsetting of all was the damage done to a highly cherished and beautiful multi-colored fine art glass bowl that was purchased from The Kimball museum less than 4 years ago for almost $600. Luckily, I found a fine glass art restorer in Washington state but the cost to repair was $500 and the shipping was $128.32. I‚Äôll lump all of these together as the 5th time AB Moving dropped the ball. The biggest take away? Do not ever leave movers unattended as literally every indiscretion that transpired happened after I left.
On 6.15.20 I sent AB Moving a complete list of all the items that were damaged along with receipts and ample imagery to substantiate my claim. The total outright financial loss I incurred was $716.31. I was offered a mere $87 instead - the 6th time AB Moving dropped the ball. I then informed them that if they chose not to compensate me for the entirety of the damages, I‚Äôd be writing very explicit, thorough and negative reviews about their co on various social media platforms. Because it‚Äôs unfortunately not until a co is held responsible in the court of public opinion, which then in turn adversely affects their reputation and ultimately business and revenues, that they begin to take note.

The Hancock's with Home Vestors made an offer on our home and assured us they wouldn't back out and at 5 pm the day before closing they called and cancelled the contract.

Daryon was extremely communicative, and was happy to answer my calls and texts subjects big and small. He turned around paperwork very fast. He also gave poignant advice about pricing bids based on location, supply of stock, and potential other buyers. One of the great things about the Trelora team was that any of their buyers brokers could show me a property. That is, on multiple occasions I asked Daryon to to see a property same day, and he worked with his team to show them to me. Jennifer was particularly helpful on that front- she showed me at least four or five properties on short notice. I am extremely satisfied with my experience with Trelora, and highly recommend it- the splitting of the buyers brokers commission didn't hurt too!"

5400,0.1108421717171717,"****BUYER BEWARE GOOD UPFRONT BUT NOT GOOD WHEN ISSUES ARISE****REVIEW THE WARRANTY THEY OFFER ITS NOT MEANT TO PROTECT YOU*****WAIT A WEEK OR SO TO WRITE YOUR REVIEW***CHECK ALL OF YOUR ELECTRICAL ITEMS UPFRONT DAY ONE******This is a follow-up To my last review. I was moved on 1-7 to my new place and as my last review states I was happy.  Due to a busy schedule I wasn't able to get my dryer hooked up until that following Sunday. The guys were nice to hook up my washer. I had to change out my cord from a 3 prong to a 4 prong which was easy for me as I used to sell appliances and deliver them and I've hooked up many dryers in my time...plus with you tube just about anyone could do it. Well sadly to say the dryer would not turn on. I tried a few different things like checking the circuit breaker and testing the outlet for power. When all attempts failed I called a repairman to come and help as like most people I needed my dryer since all laundry does is multiply. He came out and tested everything and advised me the switch on the door was broken. MY DRYER WAS WORKING FINE BEFORE I MOVED. I was shocked because it's a little more than a year old. I asked him if it could have been damaged in the move and he said it's very likely. So I called the moving company not one time but 5 times before anyone showed care or concern. I then sent them an email with bill and a summary of the issues. Things get damaged in moves all of the time plus they sell you on the fact that have insurance to help cover things that break so I wasn't sure what the issue was and why I wasn't hearing back from them. After 5 attempts I decided to give them one more chance before I filed a complaint with the BBB and updated this review as well as my social media following. Well guess who called back the next day??!! The owner who was defensive about the situation and admitted he had read my email which shows that he knew of the issue but chose not to respond until his reputation was threatened. I'm telling you, AS THE CONSUMER, like I told HIM the defining moments for any company lies within the way they handle complaints and issues, not when everything is going well. I had to make six calls before I got a response, then I received questioning and defensiveness about the whole situation. Not one ounce of concern which is unfortunate for any customer.  So we talked about it and the repair cost me a total of $360 that included a trip charge. The move itself cost me $345 plus I ended up with a dryer that worked before the move and not after the move so a total of $705 to move and repair their damage! On top of that I was ignored for weeks and then the owner called and promised to reimburse me for only the trip charge and the dryer switch which was only $60 and $80 so $140. He said he would send a check to my home address. It's been over a week and I've received nothing in the mail. For all of my trouble and through no fault of my own I've been both lied to and ignored. So yes they're good on the front end but when it comes to having issues and getting a response let alone a resolution they're less than a one star. ****BUYER BEWARE***** The warranty they offer has more about what they don't cover than what they do. It's garbage and they don't stand behind it. On top of that they will pick and chose what they want to reimburse you for.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND****Wonderful experience with Hugo, Chris H and Brian today.  I had a move scheduled for Saturday the 5th WITH A DIFFERENT MOVING COMPANY and they ended up being a no call no show which put my family in a sticky predicament. I called AM moving company on Sunday morning and they were able to move me as early as Monday morning at 9am on the 7th. They were prompt, professional and reasonably priced. They handled our belongings with care and concern for where everything should be placed. They interacted professionally with me and I felt 100% confident in their abilities to handle all types of moves and I will be hiring them for my next BIG move.

Kyle navigated us through Seattle's current real estate current gold rush over two days (and a dozen showings) and somehow we never felt rushed, only excited. He understood what we were looking for, and at the buzzer on day two we found the right place, and made our second offer of the trip. His personalized service, attention to detail, and thoughtfulness are readily apparent: Here is someone who is not just passionate about their work, but clearly understands that to be a great real estate agent, you need to understand your buyer or seller's desires.

They also had plastic wrap and they wrapped everything that could have been harmed or scratched, and they even sealed boxes for us that weren't taped. They loaded everything from small items to big ones, helped disassemble furniture, and got fragile items secured with no sweat.They packed a 27' Penske moving truck very well, secured everything so that even after a 20+ hour drive across the country nothing fell or was damaged!!!

Based on the amount of stuff we had Netzer thought it would take 12 hours and need to be split into two days. A few hours into the job he said the company would send two more people when they finished another job and we could probably get it done in one day. They only sent one more person, Ruben, so they were only able to finish loading on Saturday.

Netzer, Cruz, and Cha unloaded us on day two. They rolled out the red carpet to protect our floors and got right to work.

All 5 men were friendly, professional, and efficient. Our only complaint was with the overbooking by the company. Splitting the move into two days cost an extra $600-800."

5385,0.10947712418300654,"Overall, the move was fine. The extra stars to make it five stars are because of the three guys/movers. They were polite, professional, and incredibly hardworking. My mother was moving from a 3rd-floor apartment. On the day of the move, luck would have it, the elevator broke. My mom has a lot of stuff and over 60 boxes. The guys went up and down the stairs, packing the truck, only stopping to use the restroom. The move took 6 hours, with approximately 45 minutes of driving in rush hour traffic. If I could change anything, I would have been more accurate with the contents so they would have had a larger truck, and I wish the arrival window time frame provided was narrower. The window was from 10 am to 1 pm. You guessed it, they arrived at 1:13 pm. I understand a window is a window, and I cannot ding AB moving for that, but it was a long painful wait. AB Moving was a referral from my daughter. She had used them twice. I have family members moving this summer, and one said she will be using AB Moving after having poor experiences with other companies. Good job guys! After all that work, I did not mind tipping. I wish I could have given more."

I am a military brat and in the criminal justice field. I have had nothing but amazing experiences with moving company‚Äôs the past 23 times I‚Äôve moved. I feel as if I was overcharged in the fact that I MADE sure(double triple extra checked) to give them the correct address and told them I was going to Arlington. We drove all the way to Dallas.. it took us an additional HOUR to get to where we needed to go. So that means.. an additional $100. I am moving due to domestics situation. I was on a time crunch and they not only showed up an hour late but made us drive another hour extra. What should have taken 2 hours took 4! Charging me for the hour I waited for them in hopes that my abuser did not show up... I had the money available to pay these gentlemen but definitely would have been in a better place with the additional $200 I was ‚Äúovercharged‚Äù. Also, I do not necessarily frown upon speaking other languages around customer by all means please communicate in the easiest way for you. But when discussing various information about the customer and knowing how to speak their language, please do because I do want to know what‚Äôs being discussed. Luckily I have a minor in the language they were speaking so I understood. And I definitely understood the cat calls that I was getting which was very disrespectful... I appreciate the help and am thankful for the job they did, even flinging around my boxes that said fragile with glass rattling around in them but the effort is what matters I suppose. Will not be using this company again or suggesting them to anyone.

Having said that, the movers were very friendly, prompt, careful, and helpful. I really could have used more of their help if I had realized I was paying for the full 3 hours. Instead, I have to find a friend with a truck to move a few more items.

426,0.10833333333333335,"I recently hired Wild Cat Movers for a small move. The movers were kind and efficient. They took care to pad and wrap items. They left a few marks on the walls which is to be expected. The most concerning part was when I notified them of 2 big gashes torn in my leather sofa. After filing a claim, the owner, Zane, told me that he thought my couch was old, so he was not willing to give more than 75.00 to repair it. I contacted a leather repair company who explained a full cushion leather panel would need to be performed - not 75.00 as you might imagine. After explaining this to Zane, he forced me into mediation with the TXDMV to get any further help. We will see how this goes. When hiring discount movers, read the fine print. Your valuable contents may not be as valuable to the mover when he has to compensate for damages or make a claim. I learned long ago it's much easier to own up to problems when I mess up, than to get defensive and lose customers and referrals. Hopefully, they will convince me otherwise."

Wildcat didn‚Äôt send enough movers or trucks for our move.  That could be our fault, but we really don‚Äôt have that much stuff.  The mover said it was going to cost a lot of money for them to make a second trip that day.  I ended up renting a box truck and moving the rest myself.

While packing and settling in the last week, we‚Äôve noticed several issues.  A couple pieces of furniture have large dirt marks on them because they weren‚Äôt wrapped during the moving process.  There wasn‚Äôt enough shrink wrap on the truck that morning.  I‚Äôve found a couple of broken pieces in the garage today, which is what really prompted this post.

While moving stuff into our new house that day, I saw one of the movers riding my 2yr old daughter‚Äôs balance bike down the ramp of the truck. Besides that and the over sharing about previous small tips, these guys were pretty nice.

They arrived within the window they quoted. They took care to make sure walls, floors, and furniture would not be damaged. They even took apart my bed to get it down and up stairs. The new place was a little more challenging for them due to tight spaces but they got everything in and reassembled. Nothing was broken during the move. They did a great job despite it being over 105 degrees out. Are they the cheapest? No. But the quality and professionalism was worth it. I would use them again."

10068,0.10542091836734695,"Unfortunately, my wife and I had a bad experience with Johnine.

We were FTHB in WS. Our search was fast (under contract within 2 weeks, involving only 2 visits with Johnine, and 4 with Tonya as we did a lot of open-houses on our own). We were on top of everything and had an excellent lender (Ryan Maxwell from Homestreet) allowing us to close 3 weeks later.

We reached out to this agency after having a mediocre experience with Redfin. Given their stellar rating, we were expecting to be more lucky with Johnine and her team.

After an initial meeting with Johnine, we had some trial visits with Tonya over one evening, and it was excellent. Tonya was scouting the different homes, taking the time to discuss with us, and sounded very knowledgeable. We really enjoyed our experience and were looking forward to keep working with her.

After these visits, we only got to interact with Johnine.
To say that Johnine lacked professionalism or represents too many people is an understatement.
We only had 2 visits scheduled with her, and she had been significantly late for both (15-30 minutes), even though she is the one that set the time. Both time was because she was touring homes with another customer on the other side of Seattle and couldn‚Äôt make it on time for our visits.
This was mildly annoying, but the second property was one we wanted to put an offer on, so we stayed put.
Then, things turned chaotic. As we signified interest in putting an offer on that second property, it was a nightmare to schedule a time to meet with Johnine. The offer deadline was on a Monday, but Johnine could only meet us on the Sunday before. She had to reschedule that meeting 3 times, even though she was the one setting the time every single time.
During that meeting, Johnine did not remember the offer Deadline correctly and thought it was on Tuesday. If I didn‚Äôt bring it up, Johnine was only planning to work on drafting the offer the following day and might have missed the offer.
After our offer was accepted, communication became really abysmal. As a FTHB, I do not expect to be baby-sitted, but I was hopping that Johnine would at least detail us what to expect and when. However, she took the fact that we were on top of things as an excuse to not do anything than the bare minimum. This caused unnecessary stress on our end as we were trying to figure out stuff completely on our own. All we had from Johnine for the following 3 weeks was a brief ‚Äúnext step‚Äù email with poorly worded shallow details on what to expect, and barely understandable instructions regarding utilities. That‚Äôs it. Even at open-houses, listing agents distribute printed PDF with more useful information than what Johnine provided us.
At no point did Johnine mention anything regarding a final walkthrough that we had to schedule ourselves and that we didn‚Äôt even do with her.

The ice on the cake was closing day, where we had literally no idea what to expect the day of.
Johnine was out of town and couldn‚Äôt get the key for us, so Tonya was scheduled to do it for us and meet with us the following day.
But the day of, Tonya informed us BY EMAIL that she couldn‚Äôt make it, and that the seller‚Äôs agent left our home key under a rock in the garden for us to pick up anytime.
Neither Johnine nor Tonya tried to arrange for another agent/staff to pick up the key for us to make sure that we were able to enter our property. They did not even bother calling us to check what was the best option for us or apologize for the inconvenience.
I had to interrupt my work day in panic to go figure out what rock was the correct one and pick up the key.

Johnine received a $27,000 commission out of that purchase where I felt she did not represent us better than a Redfin agent and put no effort to represent us at any step of the process. Beware."

they were professional and polite.
I could not imagine a better mover"
7059,0.10493468915343918,"I don't really write reviews these days, but I feel compelled to write one now, because in a word - WOW. The moving gods were really looking out for me.

Finding movers is honestly one of the worst tasks, especially if you've been burned by bad movers in the past (I definitely have). I agonized over who to choose and was honestly terrified of having my stuff damaged, held hostage, lost, or having guys deliberately take their time and many breaks because $$$.

I initially picked Pure Movers because - and this will sound stupid - I liked how I was spoken to in the written quote. It wasn't an upsell situation and it wasn't aggressive. They made a point to be very clear about what they were charging, when they would charge it, and what they weren't charging for. Their rate, while still on the higher side of some of the quotes i'd received, was much lower than other companies and they assured me they don't start the clock until they get to you (love).

For my actual move, three men were supposed to show up. Asan texted when they were on their way and when they arrived. They were also on time. So far, so good. I'd ordered some of those No Parking easels since I was living on a busy arterial road and to nobody's surprise, just my annoyance, nobody obeyed them. The movers assured me that wasn't a big deal; they'd just park in the median. Certainly not ideal, and definitely not a safe choice for them, but they rolled with it.

They were meticulous with the move itself. They were friendly, efficient, well-organized, and communicative, and wrapped my furniture seemingly like they would if it were their own. I never once felt like I needed to babysit them or hunt them down. It's a small thing, but they really put me at ease during such a stressful event.

Six hours and many, many flights of stairs later, they were all done, and not one thing was damaged or lost. If such a word can be applied to this process, I'd say it was perfection.

I'd give them a 20/10. I will absolutely be using them again in the future and highly recommend you call them if you're in need! Thank you Pure Movers, Asan, and team!!!"
2502,0.1048735119047619,"We've been moving since 2019! This year we moved to Texas. The 1st TX home was an awful and unsafe rental house. Angie was sympathetic and professional of our plight. She managed to squeeze us into their tight schedule to move us out and into another place, thank you! The guys deserve 10 stars rather than 5! Aside from being an hour early they were also very respectful! They asked questions and assessed each area of the move. They had a smooth and efficient process and they communicated well to each other (not yell out). They handled each piece as if it were breakable. Phoenix appeared to have top notch moving equipment too, hydraulic lifts on their trucks. This allowed the truck to park closer to the house. No item of ours was damaged during the move. And no damage occurred to the prior home and current home during the move. Thanks guys & Phoenix for the blessings!"

174,0.10458333333333335,"Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience with Wildcat movers. I hired them based on awesome google reviews, but it did not go well in my case.

Some of the guys who came out and Allie at their office were awesome and worked really hard (and I feel bad for them that the move did not end well even after their best efforts). However, some of the guys lacked training/experience on unpacking and packing. It caused major chaos as they lost screws, stuff was broken as it was not packed properly, they ran out of packaging material / blankets etc.

If you decide to hire them, PLEASE make sure you understand their insurance terms. Unless you buy additional insurance, they would only cover about $1 a pound of the damaged item. This would be a major issue for expensive electronics etc as you would end up getting almost nothing compared to actual cost of goods.

I did not pay attention to insurance details and ended up paying a very heavy price. Hope y'all avoid the mistakes I made."

3.  I never felt like this move might not happen.  I had peace of mind, because they are a big company with good bandwidth.

Negatives:

1. Showed up late, but called.
2.  Gave me a flat price for 3 trucks.  My stuff fit in 2.5 trucks.  I feel they should have told me ahead of time that if I just got rid of a little bit of stuff, I could save myself $3,000.
3.  When they quoted me, they justified their bill by saying this will take three full long days to get the move done.  The first two days were 4-5 hour days. The third day was a full day.
4.  They couldn‚Äôt move my treadmill into the house.

4492,0.09962905452035885,"I needed some movers around the Magnolia area and found Eco Movers just down the street. The process for getting a move started with an inventory pack list to get an estimate followed by some introductory calls from the Eco Movers office.

On move day, Semisi and Josh arrived on time with a 20 minute heads up 8:00am sharp. I had a mountain of packed boxes and they made short work of the boxes, efficiently moving it from the second floor to garage in no time, no less in the pouring rain! The crew paid special attention to delicate furniture, making sure to wrap and protect everything. Travis jumped on later to help speed things up and we finished before the estimated time.

The crew was extremely professional, courteous, fast paced, and gentle with all the items. To my surprise, nothing has broken during the move. A few scuffs were made on the walls, but Eco Movers made absolutely sure to match the paint and get them touched up. Moving inherently involves bumping into walls especially with a time constraint, they went out of their way to solve the problem and that makes Eco Movers that much better of a company compared to other movers I've used in the past.

I think what makes Eco Movers that much better is the customer service during and after the move. They kept constant contact with me to ensure everything went right and the fact that nothing broke shows the quality nature in their work and experience."

Shortly thereafter, they sent someone out.  Not surprisingly, they were unable to find the furniture BECAUSE IT WAS LOST BY THEM DURING THE MOVE, HELLO.  The guy who was here said, ""they'll be in touch.""  Here we are, more than two weeks later, and NADA.  No phone call, they aren't responding to my emails, nothing.

They did, however, spam me with a discount coupon to give to a friend if anyone I know is planning to move.  HAHAHAHAHA, thanks, guys.  At least I got a good laugh out of it.

tl;dr:  DO NOT RECOMMEND.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Original Review:

We used Ecomovers for a move on December 28, 2016.. In the course of the move, most of our patio furniture went missing.  Ecomovers insist that they have no idea what happened to it.  The patio furniture was the last thing they loaded on the truck and should have been the first thing they unloaded at the house.  We did not realize that the furniture was missing until we finished unpacking all of the boxes in the garage (we thought the patio furniture was buried behind the boxes).

Back story:  Through the course of the move, I reminded them several times about the patio furniture.  When we first discussed it early in the day, the lead mover picked up a small side table and an ottoman for the furniture and loaded them in the truck.  They then went back to loading the rest of the boxes and furniture in the house.  I reminded them again when the truck was fully loaded, and they loaded the remaining furniture last (two swivel rockers and a second ottoman).

Interestingly, the move was from a location 0.5 miles from our house, but the movers took almost 40 minutes to get from the rental house to our house and gave me no explanation for the delay.  At the time we were busy unloading our own cars and didn't question them on where they were, but now I am thinking that something happened during the interim - perhaps they didn't properly latch the door and the furniture fell out?

I've called and emailed Ecomovers repeatedly about this.  They first suggested that maybe the furniture was still at the rental house (not the case.)  They then suggested that maybe we just hadn't found it at our house (also not the case - it's kind of hard to not notice patio furniture!)  The rep I spoke with said that the movers remembered loading the furniture into the truck, but did not remember where they put the furniture when we arrived back home.  They say that there is nothing they can do because their guys ""can't remember"" where they put it.  The only pieces we have left are the first two pieces they loaded (side table and one ottoman).

The contract allows for a whopping $0.60 per pound for items lost or damaged.  The furniture they lost was purchased at Summer House in Bellevue and cost us $2,500 new.  They have offered me nothing in compensation other than offering to refund the 40 minutes worth of time when the movers went missing.

Other than this, my experience was great (but that's kind of like asking Mrs. Lincoln ""how did you like the play?"").  Since we didn't realize that the furniture was missing at the time, we profusely thanked our movers and gave them a large cash tip ($300).  We also bought them breakfast and lunch through the day.  I feel like I was taken advantage of in a huge way and am terribly disappointed in their service."

In the beginning, he met us at our home and reviewed all of the listing contract and then assisted us with our listing and pricing.  He then took professional pictures of our home, provided a sign for our yard, and provided a  key lock for realtors to have access.  A few days later, he had completed the MLS listing, sent it to us for approval, and then posted it on multiple websites.   He also signed us up for a website that allows us to receive notifications for showings which allows the owner to approve or disapprove/move the showing times.  That website also sent reviews of the home by the agents that showed the home, a very helpful feature.   A few times we had realtors (and one individual that was unrepresented by a realtor) reach out to Tod to express interest and/or ask questions.  Tod was always very prompt and very professional in forwarding information to us to respond.   We had a contract on the home within 6 days.  Tod helped to facilitate our negotiations by giving his professional advice on the contract and guided us on contractual verbiage and laws.   We were able to close on the home in less than one month.   All in all, it was a wonderful experience.   We would HIGHLY recommend DFW City Homes and Tod to anyone looking for a Flat Fee Service listing."
5548,0.09825131009341535,"Hired wildcat to help with our move (within the DFW metro).  I decided to go with them based on a referral.

The crew did show up on time and were friendly. All went fine except for two things. 1) I had treadmill they complained was too heavy to move upstairs, and with the added risk of damaging my newly remodeled home, they left it downstairs but never re-assembled it. 2) they didn‚Äôt reconnect the washer correctly in my new home (the drain hose that goes into the wall was left dangling). When my wife ran the washer, it flooded the laundry room and damaged the adjacent wood floors (again, we just remodeled the home including the floors). Now the adjacent wood flooring next to the laundry room is warping. Luckily for Wildcat, they have you sign a disclaimer that keeps them from being liable for water damages related to reconnections, though I would have expected a crew who does this professionally to not have made such a mistake. Nonetheless, I attempted to file a claim but was promptly denied with quick reference to the disclaimer above.

Again, they almost had it right. The treadmill is manageable, the team was also nice and organized when scheduling, but the damage to the flooring and costs associated with it outweigh all the positives from my experience with them."

He gave us a one hour intro to the real estate market to help us learn about the search, offer, and closing process, and to set our expectations correctly. Being a working family of four with two little ones, we had to view houses on the weekends, which Justin always accommodated. If he wasn't available, he would have someone on his team help us, which only happened once.

He spent a lot of time educating us on the process and we never felt pushed by him to make an offer that we weren't totally invested in. When push came to shove, he delivered and we won an offer on a house after our fourth offer.

We tried to be reasonable and Daniel (Manager Dallas location) is one of the most unprofessional people we‚Äôve ever spoken to. Our move was the biggest disaster we‚Äôve ever encountered. The movers themselves were extremely polite, however they sent 2 of them and a truck to move our furniture out of a 3800 sq ft home. They told us it would take 6 hours give or take an hour. At 10 hours they had just gotten the truck loaded and didn‚Äôt even load the entirety of what we had asked for. Which we had to move ourselves! Our walls had puncture marks from furniture going into them and several pieces of furniture were also damaged. We immediately reached out when our walls were hit. They offered us a $100 to pay someone to patch them and repair. Please let me know where you can find that in 24 hours before we needed to be out for $100. I called Wildcat again because the move was going so slow. They said they were sending other workers to help expedite the process, but never did. Once our belongings were off the truck we said we were done. The move was suppose to include them reassembling the furniture, but we refused to keep paying when it felt like it could take hours more. Then we pay the invoice presented to us, which seemed reasonable considering everything that happened. Only to get sent a separate invoice for more money after it said we had paid the grand total. They refuse to fix any of our belongings unless we pay the invoice. Now they‚Äôre threatening to send us to collections! I don‚Äôt know how they received the 5 star reviews they did, but they must be either from other Wildcat franchise locations or they‚Äôre not real!
This was a 3-4 man job, period. They made the mistake when they gave us the estimate. Not us! We did a video walk through of all the furniture we needed moved. You would think professionals with 5 star reviews would surely know how to do a proper estimate.

4530,0.09536749482401656,"This review is purely for the ""Moving Coordinators"" as I did not choose Eco Movers to perform the actual move.

I had reached out to over 5 local moving companies, including Eco Movers. I ultimately decided not to book with Eco Movers as their rates were not competitive for such a small move. While I have no doubt they would execute the move well, their Moving Coordinators (I mostly dealt with Cindy) made this experience very unprofessional.

I noticed while going through the quotes that they had actually booked a move while providing the quote. This did not happen with any other company, but they offer free cancellation so I made an effort to cancel ahead of time so they could potentially fill the slot with a different client. The coordinator I spoke to that day (not Cindy) was very polite and easy to deal with.

The following day, I receive an email from Cindy telling me to book a time slot soon as they fill up quickly. I did not respond as I had already cancelled the move, and it should be clear from the cancellation the day before I was no longer interested. Instead, I receive a call the next day from Cindy asking me to rebook, fully aware that I had already called to cancel.

If you are going to auto-schedule people, please expect them to cancel for any reason. There should not be 2 followups after a cancellation, considering these scenarios usually mean a different company was already chosen."

In the same meeting, we also had an exercise which helped us narrow down our checklist.

Remington remained responsive to our needs. Before we landed our dream house, we were very close to making an offer on another one. However, after consideration, we decided not to make the offer. Kim and Remington listened closely to why we loved that house and why we decided to back off, and quickly got back to the game mode.

We didn‚Äôt have to wait long till our dream house came into the picture. That weekend my boyfriend and I scheduled three house tours, among which, one had met all of our requirements on paper. ¬†A few hours prior to our tour, we received¬†texts from Remington and informed us that there was already an offer on our dream house. If we were serious about it, we would need to see the house right away and worked on an offer immediately after. ¬†That time we were in the middle of an UW Husky Basketball game ¬†(Side note: the game ended up being the 1,000 wins for Huskies in the Alaska stadium :)). Without Remington, we would have missed our dream house. ¬†Thanks to him and Kim, we were able to check out our dream house and put together a¬†competitive offer before the deadline. ¬†And viola, we secured our Valentine‚Äôs Day gift to each other.

Just as we thought all the hard work had already passed, we entered the negotiation and inspection stage, which in my opinion, really tested realtor‚Äôs expertise and customer obsession. ¬†Kim and Remington well represented us in the entire negotiation and inspection process. ¬†This allowed us to fully understand the pros and cons of each decision. ¬†In the end, we were able to waive the closing cost; instead spent on fixing things we had discovered during the inspection process. ¬†As new house owners, we also received many recommendations from them on contractors and do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts in the initial stage.

From the time we started engaging with Kim and Remington till the time we closed our house, it was only a short one month and half. ¬†We realized that the process was much shorter compared with other people‚Äôs experience, and we were also relatively fortunate that the market wasn‚Äôt as crazy, but we hope the stress and emotion involved were relatable. ¬†We thanked great partnership and dedication from Kim and Remington, who were with us every step in the process; without them, we wouldn‚Äôt be able to quickly complete the upgrade, and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to write this review while enjoying the sunshine in our back porch."

8978,0.09377547403863193,"This review will be forwarded to the VA, and the other US Military agencies who handle these type of incidences with their service members and retirees.
I‚Äôm a 25 year retired, 100% disabled VET, now working in DOD the past 20 years in the Middle East, training our fine US military.
I was awaken by my phone and another young lad, was soliciting me to buy one of my homes in FT. Worth, Texas. 761**. So being that I had the house built in 2007, and have been doing DOD contracting work in the Middle East , the past 20 years, all my homes have not ever been lived in, and I don‚Äôt do the renting thing, thus still look new inside and out. I have replaced the roof in 2022 and put up a new fence in 2023.
The young lad who seemed to be pretty cordial, asked me how much I was willing to sell that particular home for and I responded that because the taxes went up to the appraisal of $361k, it would have to coincide, because my taxes had raised as well astronomically.
He said not to worry and that his buyer company wanted to discuss the purchase of it and was going to make me a good deal. After he jotted down my email and confirmed my name and phone number, I really didn‚Äôt think much of it mainly because I‚Äôve had a lot of calls in the past few years on this subject and thus I just rolled over and went back to sleep.
A few days later I received a voice message from a woman named Lydia, (I still have the voice message from her, and I‚Äôll try to upload it so everyone that wants can verify what I‚Äôm stating here is true.) My caller ID confirmed she was calling from a phone belonging to, Investorade Homebuyers, in Dallas, Texas, which was a relief because most of the homebuyer companies that called were either from New York or California. Local is good. So I thought.
So after training that day, (5 October 2023), I went home and that evening I decided to contact this woman Lydia, whom was so anxious for me to call her. (I‚Äôll share the voice message audio). She answered the phone and I informed her who I was and I was returning her call and she asked me again who I was and paused. She asked what house and how many bedrooms. And asked me to wait a second after she asked my name again. She then returned to the line in an unpleasant demeanor asking if my house was ^gray brick‚Äù in which I said ‚Äúyes ma‚Äôam. And she commenced to yelling and calling me a ‚ÄúSCAMMER‚Äù, and don‚Äôt call her again and that she does want to do any business or anything and hung up on me.
To say the least I was taken aback. Why would she think I was a scammer when she contacted me? I tried to call back but again she hung up with out answering.  So, I texted her and described my home to her and how many and the type of vehicles I had in the driveway, gave her my email address as well as my younger brother‚Äôs name, and that he is the first black Four Star Marine General in history just so she could get the clue I was no scammer. Then it dawned on me, scammer wasn‚Äôt the word she wanted to use, an excuse phrase, for my ethnic voice. ‚ÄúI have the text message‚Äù.
So, I used my secondary international phone which is also a Fort Worth area code and which she answered and I immediately said Ms Lydia,  there must be some kind of mistake, you contacted me and left a choice message and I‚Äôm retired military working in Kuwait, you can contact my dad in Ft Worth to clear this matter, I‚Äôm not any type of scammer. She immediately said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care, I don‚Äôt want to have any business dealings or anything else with you. In which she again disrespectfully hung up in my face.
I checked their website (Lydia Nolan)  and the company picture displayed some diversity so, I‚Äôm not going blame it on the company, it‚Äôs that disrespect woman Lydia. Don‚Äôt deal with her. FB. Have a nice day! I guess she thinks I was going to let this slide. I‚Äôve just started."

They were really nice and professional and fast! Just got down to business. They made my life and move so much easier! I had a very heavy old wooden set of drawers that I was dead set on getting up in the attic turned toy room. The stairs are crazy steep and tiny since it was an attic. I told myself I‚Äôd get it up there be it would be nearly impossible for these larger guys to. üòÇbut Jordan asked where the drawers was going I said ‚Äúultimately up there but you can leave them here‚Äù he took a look and said ‚Äúwe can do that I think‚Äù and sure enough they somehow did.

When we first toured the home that we ultimately purchased, Rob pointed out many important details that were not obvious to us from the listing sheet that we would have otherwise overlooked. Within five days of meeting him, Rob helped us put together a competitive offer based on the current real estate market dynamics.

He was extremely communicative with us and the listing agent throughout the process.?The rapport he established with the listing agent gave us visibility and credibility that enabled our offer to ultimately be accepted.

We highly recommend Rob as a buyer's agent. He is extremely friendly to work with and was receptive to our opinions on what we were looking for in our home. We can't thank him enough for all his hard work!"

606,0.09211111111111117,"I couldn't in good conscious recommend these movers.  On the plus side, everyone is super friendly.  The movers themselves were so nice I ended up tipping them well.  I wish I hadn't done that.  It sends the wrong message.  The reason I did is because on both days the guys were very nice making a dreadful task (moving) much more tolerable.  But as a whole this was a bad experience.  First they quoted an estimate of a grand a day for $2k total estimate. This included one day for packing and one day for moving.  In the end each day cost me $1500 excluding the tip.  I realize it's an estimate but missing an estimate by 1/3 is pretty significant.  I can't begin to imagine why it took so long (thus the higher cost) as I have moved over 10 times and it has not taken this long.  So all of this said....I probably wouldn't have posted this review.  However, to seal the deal, I still have an entertainment center that has not been put together.  It took them so long with moving my stuff that it was extremely late in the day and they didn't have some of the hardware needed (keep in mind I mentioned all pieces that would need to be assembled and that one of them was not currently assembled when I received the initial estimate from their office).  One of the guys told me he would come back the next day to finish the job (assembly of this piece of furniture).  He did not call me the next day.  He has not called me since.  And he has not shown up to assemble the furniture.  And yes....I did already tip.  I've been around a lot of situations.  I know better.  But I did it anyway.  And here we are.  I won't recommend these folks to anyone I know...and I do know several that are about to move.  I would suggest you not use them either."

They fought for us HARD, and never gave up on making the sale happen. I know we are the rare case that throws off the balance of how the company can profit for offering services at a flat rate -- if every sale was as tough as ours I don't think the system would work -- but regardless, they did not give us discount service. We received a full service experience complete with quick and thorough communication and a real estate team that worked tirelessly for us, even after the official closing. We are so thankful for Blake and the rest of the Seattle Trelora team and cannot thank them enough!

4562,0.09199134199134198,"CONSUMER BEWARE!!! The only reason they are getting a star is because the actual movers were great even with the deck stacked against them. MILITARY FAMILIES BEWARE. DO NOT USE THEM, as a military wife of 17 years I  dealt with a lot of moving companies, this company is the ABSOLUTE WORST. Arron Hernandez, the coordinator is rude, incompetent and should be fired. I spoke with A.H./ A.. Hole in early March to schedule my move for April 18th, . I told him the main reason for hiring them was because I needed packers to pack up 20 or so pictures; my husband and I collect original artwork. I explained that husband recently had surgery and had weight restriction on how much he could lift. After reviewing everything he told me 50/hr for the packer and 100/hr for the movers. A.H. called the day prior to confirm the appointment. The movers show up instead of the packers, they had no boxes ,or supplies to safely transport my pictures . When I finally spoke with A.H. he thought it was amusing that he forgot to send the packers and stated they could pack for me...uh not at 100/hr. If he wanted to do that I felt he should adjust my price. He arrogantly stated that he wasn't going to do that. I asked him if I could speak to his supervisor and he hung up on me. One of the movers called the supervisor and he was no better. They kept trying to tell me that it was cheaper to allow three movers to pack and move me because it was 3 of them. The move was a total disaster, ALOT of my belongings that wasn't packed are still at the old house AND they broke the glass out of the biggest most expensive piece of artwork I own...why because they didn't have it packed right because of A.H.'s incompetency. The movers themselves got the glass replaced and returned my picture to me the same day( hence the one star). I understand that mistakes happen but if you make one be responsible enough to try and accommodate your customer the best way you can, not just say oh well and be arrogant about it. a $500 job (including packing and moving)  turned out to be $700 because I paid 100/hr for them to pack. I was stuck between a rock and a hard spot and they knew it.

1047,0.08974353928899381,"Phoenix Express was excellent for our cross country move.  We had other options which were cheaper but only with Phoenix Express were we assured at least 4 Dallas, Texas  employees would travel with our goods to unpack us in Delaware (it turned out to be 5), they could trailer our two cars so we had them on our first day in our new city and our items would go direct to our destination without being unloaded or mixed with another household.  The large crew going with the load was important to me because we've experienced movers who contracted for help on the destination side of the transaction and the movers were not as good at the destination as they were at the origin.  We've also experienced them not being able to find help so it took 14 hours for 2 very tired movers to unload the truck. In one of our past moves one of the movers at the destination had a broken leg and he was carrying our items hopping on one foot!  Phoenix Express was also so fast - they swarmed our house with over 10 people to load so it was just a few hours instead of all day.  On the destination side they were all unloaded, beds set up, furniture placed by 11:00 am.  Our new house has a very tight stair case and they expertly took a huge couch up through it without damage to the walls or the light hanging over the landing. It seemed an impossible task, but they did it!  The last thing which I appreciated is they spent time placing the rugs and furniture where I wanted them and putting back together whatever they took apart (e.g. a standing lamp, beds, etc).

What should have taken them 2-2.5 hours (because I have had it moved before with only 2 people) turned into 3.5 hours which I can only attribute to the fact that they used a slow lift on the back of the truck instead of a ramp.  They left before me (at my old place), but it took them 15-20 minutes longer to get to my new place. I had time to take a wrong turn, go in and get my keys, and sit in my new place for several minutes before they arrived.

Masks were used on and off (mostly off), but I was able to social distance to stay clear most of the time.

Frustratingly, they were not honest about getting everything out of my apartment.  When I went back to clean, I found they had left my cat scratching post contraption, 2 chairs, and a box.  It‚Äôs fine that they couldn‚Äôt fit it; I just wish they had been honest.

Only after i dropped him was he able to magically manifest units that were actually within my budget, but by this time, it was too late.

We listed on a Thursday, had 100 showings, 250 walk throughs and 5 top-dollar offers the following Monday!  Just prior to finalizing the Sale, an issue came up with the City of Kirkland regarding an open permit for a Heat Pump installation a year prior.  As we had already moved out of WA state, Jesse went way above and beyond (opening the house, meeting the City inspectors, posting the permits)  to help us work with the City of Kirkland to address the permit issue so we could do final closing. With no help from the City (they wrote up several other 20 year old issues that they said needed to be addressed and permitted before they would release the house for final sale), we finally closed 2 months later!  All through this very trying time working with the City of Kirkland, Jesse stood right with us, keeping a calm head, and walking us through it step-by-step.

The crew that packed and picked up our items were VERY GOOD. The crew that delivered our items were not. Also, we sustained some minor damage which I tried to work with the company to remedy. We had purchased the insurance which turned out to be not so good either. I fixed the damage on my own and after talking with Joe, I felt we should at least be compensated for our time and the hardware/glue we had to purchase to make the repairs. Not a word back after promising he would talk to the owner. Customer service did NOTHING but argue with me. Had thought about filing a claim but needed estimates and a dated inventory from the delivery. The inventory Joe emailed me was not dated and NUMEROUS requests to get a dated inventory were not answered.  Customer service kept telling me Joe sent what we needed to file the claim even though he had not. I kept telling them we needed the DATED INVENTORY AND ADDRESS OF THE STORAGE FACILITY but they ignored every request. It is now too late to file a claim and no one has reached out to us to even pay for the materials to fix the damaged items. I would not recommend this company. Very poor customer service and follow up. I feel their motto should be ""take the money and run"". BEWARE!!!!

So, the business responds telling me they will ""fix it""???? Really?? You did nothing for almost NINE MONTHS even though I called constantly for WEEKS and was yanked around. This move cost over $8000 and even if I had decided to make a claim, I was not provided with the NECESSARY INFORMATION on the warehouse location which was REQUIRED for my claim. Your people NEVER DATED THE INVENTORY which also prevented me from filing a claim. NO ONE SEEMED CONCERNED ABOUT FIXING THIS."

However, the move into a one bedroom apartment within the same community took nearly 5 hours and they had no sense of urgency during the move.

778,0.07904040404040405,"EDITED:

Updating the review to a higher score based on the hard work ethic and care taken by the moving crew when they became available to move me. The office reached out to me earlier this week to listen and take note on lessons learned and explained where disconnects happened that resulted in a less than stellar start to the move.

Because my move was on a Sunday, there were no office staff to field calls for move status or relay info on delays. The company does have a feature that allows text message notifications and responses, but this was not shared with me until after the move took place. Make sure you sign up for this, even if not moving on a Sunday!

The move prior to mine had an undocumented request for unpacking services that pushed back my movers from reaching me until 4:15 pm (4 hours later than projected). The times quoted turned out to be for a block of estimated arrival times, not for the duration I would have the movers - something I made sure to clarify with the office when originally scheduling back in June and was wrongly told the opposite. The office further did not note the hard stop time of 5:00 pm on my file and I was later told I should have been advised me to take what would have been the morning slot of 7:00 am - 11:00 am (a start time of Noon vs. anytime between Noon and 4:00 pm definitely makes a difference, particularly when my new building only allowed me to move in between 11:00 am - 5:00 pm).

Outside of the communication issues with the front office prior to the move, the movers themselves were wonderful. Eco Movers was able to send an extra person at no extra charge to try and help stage my boxes and furniture prior to the main crew arriving to help expedite my move. Tracy, Zeph, Brandon, and the rest of the moving team made up for the stressful day. I would still use Eco Movers if moving again, though next time will call the office ahead of moving to reconfirm all details are accurate.
_________________________

Had previously used Eco Movers when I moved apartments in Seattle in 2014, and they were prompt, efficient, and worked hard to make my move seamless. This time around is proving to be very different.

The moving team is 1.5 hours late and counting with no way of contacting them to get a status update of when they'll leave to reach me. Attempts to reach Eco Movers directly were met by a third party answering service that advised the office is closed on the weekends and holidays and will be able to address my moving issues in the next 2-5 business days. Unacceptable. I received confirmation emails and a call last Friday confirming the date and time, so this is not a clerical error as far as can be told.

I scheduled this move 2 months ahead of time for an estimated 4 hour move with the note that my new location had a hard deadline of 5:00 pm to be unloaded due to loading dock and elevator access restrictions. It is now after 1:30 pm and I have no way of knowing if the movers will be at my current location today at all let alone fully loaded and unloaded in the next couple hours. The bonus contractual clause to all of this is I'm obligated to pay them for the full 4 hours even if I do not (or cannot) use them for that time. Moving is inherently a stressful activity and Eco Movers have situated their services to make this experience more stressful given the lack of support and communication."

We did not have much furniture or boxes for them to move. Yet, they did a tremendous amount of damage to our property and belongings. A lot of time was wasted on the phone and emailing them and trying to get them to respond.

We had Johnny and 2 other movers 'help us out'. They scratched our floors wile moving in the fridge, caused dings in doors. We found these issues and called the company multiple times. After several calls and emails the company sent a helpful person to come and take a look at the floors, doors etc. He was helpful. But last week, we used two of our beds (a king and a queen) for the first time after the move. While on the king bed, we noticed unusual creaking and cracking sounds and the mattress itself was at an angle. My husband and I had to remove the big heavy mattress ourselves to examine what was going on underneath. Turns out they had assembled the bed all wrong, slats were unsupported, they drilled nails into the wood that shouldn't have been placed there (that should have given them a clue that they were doing something wrong - but they of course didn't care) etc. My husband and I did our best to fix the various issues and put the mattress back on, but essentially we will have to buy a new bed frame and slats. The queen bed was also assembled in a manner that caused a lot of cracks and issues. We will have to buy a new queen bed as well.

Overall, these people have cost us a lot of money. I will not be using them again and would not recommend them to anyone."

They also had an entire long driveway and a parking spot they could have easily pulled into but the driver told me there was no way he could pull in the drive way. I don't know how this is possible since our drive way is much smaller and we literally were in the same situation when we moved in. Additionally, just like everyone else in the neighborhood, they should park on the side of the street if they aren't capable of parking the truck. The guy was very rude and clearly felt that the laws are above him and his moving truck. Pine street is the main road for hundreds of neighbors in the area so its absurd that Pure Moving Company would assume that they can just block off the traffic without a permit. Unacceptable.

My family and I have called upon ECO Movers several times and they have ALWAYS EXCEEDED our expectations!!

Being a girl, especially one with ridiculous annoying demands along with being extremely particular about having things packed and moved in an attentive and delicate manner...each one of these men go above and beyond!! Their strength, as well as being the ""Hotties"" they ALWAYS are...okay maybe that's going too far...not!! They are truly kind, sweet, friendly, patient with all my constant requests, and repeatedly reassuring me, without me even asking, throughout the job that all will be done to perfection...not to worry.

Each and every time we have used them for even huge moves requiring two 24ft trucks they arrive FULLY LOADED with any and every supply needed for our move to go smoothly like our last huge move on November 20th. They carried all of our Restoration Hardware HUGE heavy pieces without even flinching!!! As well as genuine smiles, laughter and even a few moments of sudden singing...which truly made the whole experience even more enjoyable.

The process and intense time they take to wrap every valuable in thick blankets then wrap completely over that with plastic to secure followed by taping it up tight...and even then securing breakables in their heavy boxes...is insurmountable!!

They dOn't even take breaks!! Non stop working and on the swift active move the entire time!!
Not sure how they do it.

NEVER ONCE HAS A SINGLE ITEM OR VALUABLE, no matter how big or small, EVER BEEN DAMAGED or BROKEN.

By the end of the job, as always, they drive away with us feeling as though they are part of our family.

My husband and I will always be indebted to these incredibly friendly hard working teams of men.

ECO Movers has definitely ""Raised the Bar"" to all other movers period!

The television wasn't taken out of the box and some items the padding or whatever was never removed.

To add insult to injury Austin, who I guess is a manager called to discuss the issue. When I tell you this man had literally no empathy. Not even ""I understand your frustration "".

The crew led by Juan was so professional, and they even answer questions with respect of the customer, ""yes ma'am, and no ma'am. I love it!"

I sent photos of the damaged items and the dirty carpet.  I forwarded receipts to their management team totaling $320. They sent me a settlement letter for $40  even though I clearly sent them my actual replacement cost. They wouldn't budge.  I used All my sons on my previous move and they had no issues with providing me with my replacement costs.  Pretty simple.  You get what you pay for! Cheaper isn't always better .

His team was extremely communicative throughout the closing process, checking in multiple times a week to make sure we felt fully in the loop. And when I say above and beyond, I really mean it - Rob came to bring us our keys and introduced us to a flooring guy who helped us get brand new floors put in within the 5 day period between closing and moving in.

He pulled the classic bait and switch, quoted for 2 movers, but 3 showed up thus increasing the price substantially.

On the day of the moved he tried to change our appointment to earlier to fit his personal schedule he said, to a time way earlier than we could be ready for. The movers that arrived were great though, polite, friendly, and knew what they were doing.

3819,0.07213412931154868,"Well i try not to do bad reviews on companies because everyone is trying to make a living. After the experience I had yesterday/thus morning with AB Moving. I will not be silent. Brace yourself because this review it a long one:

When i booked my service I was told I would have six men and two ‚Äútrucks‚Äù. Instead I got six men and two trailers.
My heart dropped when they arrived. When i booked the service i was very transparent with the fact that i have over 100 boxes and bags and a lot of furniture and miscellaneous items. I thought that two trucks would be the same as my neighbors that moved the day before with two men and a truck. They had two 18 wheelers type moving trucks  & 4men. Their home was way bigger with way more things than i had and all their stuff fit with room to spear.

The individuals under the crewmen were very professional and personable. But the hispanic man that led the second crew was not. He felt comfortable enough to tell my daughter, ‚Äú if i new you guys more closely , I would tell your mother not to buy do many things‚Äù

First off how dare he. His job is to move my things no matter what! Secondly, you don't address my daughter if you have an issue with my decisions and third don't tell me how to spend my money. Then because he refused to bring my fridge in and said the crew that had already left will do it. This resulted in me having to throw away all my refrigerated items because it took the first crew a while to get back here,  remove my front door to get the fridge in.

While moving me the guy over the first crew complained that he doesn‚Äôt usually move bags. (‚ÄúI told the person I scheduled with that I will need to use bags for the food after I was told to take it out. Meat can‚Äôt defrost in boxes‚Äù) He proceeded to complain that he is use to boxes and the bags will throw his back out. Mind you i only used the contractor bags for the food i was told that I had to clear out my freezers for the movers and our covers.

Only to be told that i never had to remove my meats nor have the freezer defrosted, which ruined most of my meat overnight. I was told by the movers that i only had to remove breakables. So dispatch gave me information that cost me half the meats in my upright freezer and half in my chest freezer.

Then one truck had to make a trip 1 hour and 30 minutes one way back to my old place to get the items that wouldn‚Äôt fit in the two trailers on the first trip. I specifically told the guy over the first crew that i wanted my safe on the first load. He assured me that it would be. Only for him to claim he forgot and left it for the second load. I plan on going through it today to make sure nothing is missing considering he left here around 3 something heading to get what he claimed was only a few large items and didn't make it back until almost 11pm. For a table set and only a few mire items according to him.

He called me at 4:08 pm after he left and asked for the third time if I wanted him to close out my ticket because of the time is still running and he was finishing up a 30 minute break. He seemed not to want to bring my other items. I explained that i had no other way to get my things which is why i booked them. Well it end it was over $1300 for one truck and over $2600 for the second one which was 15.15 hours on the second truck which put them at 12:15 the next morning finishing up. Mind you they started at 8:30am.

I will never use or recommend this moving service to anyone else. I am very disappointed with the equipment and the crew leaders. The crews under them were awesome but the leaders fell short and it it cost me over $3900 just to move a 2800sq house. It would have been cheaper had I used two men and a truck like my neighbors because they were done moving them completely within 4-6 hours."

While I have no issues that someone else submitted an offer, Tonya failed to contact me and my agent to let us know that was the issue.

1962,0.06983471074380164,"Well I want to start by saying that this is really disappointing. I hired Wildcat because they seemed so nice on the phone they were eager to get me to use their company and they told me I would be covered if anything got damaged with my move. Well, almost everything got damaged and I will submit the photos as well so that you can see.

The worse part is, when I submitted a claim to Wildcat the SAME DAY,  they said that I signed for my items not to be wrapped and tried to find whatever loophole they could so that I would not be covered by the insurance of 1.20$ per lb per item that was damaged during the move.
I will attach photos to show that they wrapped my items and it was still damaged due to improper handing and placement in their truck.

Finally after days , I receive an email saying that the reason they are not responding is because they have up to 90 days to send me a settlement letter but also that they are ""really busy for the summer"" and can't respond in a timely manner.

It gets worse,
Once I submitted the photos and the weight along with the brand of my items that have been damaged, they sent me a settlement letter with the incorrect item weight and they didn't include all the items that were damaged. I have sent 3 emails back to them asking them to correct this which I still have not received a response.

Here is a list of things they damaged (over 1000$)
-Willow Dining table- the ends were dragged on concrete ruining the ends of the table tearing through the protective wrap. (800$)
- Modani-Dining chair fabric - placed my chairs on top of each other and nicked the fabric the chair (115$)
- Ravenna Console table in blue - both sides were damaged and scratched, paint is completely off the table.  (150$)
- Overstock-Bedroom side table - the wood is chipped on the tables and broken off. (75$)

Their settlement letter offered me $158 dollars, and they haven't  sent me a new one with all the items included.

I would have been more lenient if they had a proper response time and better customer service.
Prior to hiring them, I could not get them to stop texting me or calling me but once damage has been done, I cant seem to get a response and that is why now I am leaving this review.

I have furthermore contacted the TXDMV and submitted a claim against Wildcat movers. I hope this can be resolved in a timely manner and appropriately"

She was able to take a very uncomfortable and quite frankly disappointing experience and turn it into one that left us with hope and feeling empowered.

The moving crew (which is called Justin's crew) that I got did come late due to having some issues with their truck. The good thing was that they informed me about it ahead of time. One of the guys explained how the cost went. For my case, it was $30 dollars for gas and $110.00 dollars per hour with the use of 3 men. All the men were nice, respectful, and efficient from getting all of my things from the ABF freight truck to their truck. Then they met up with me at my apartment to unload. The crew still worked fast in an efficient way while it was over 100 degrees outside. At the end, they only charged me for 2 hours plus the $30.00 for the gas.

8665,0.0667008960032216,"I decided to move from Fort Lauderdale to Miami so I can be close to work.  I resided in same place for several years, so it was with much trepidation and worry about the integrity of realtors nowadays, that I made first contact and emailed Miami Realty Solution Group (among other agencies) for assistance.  It was Sunday morning and I had just finished my shift, as I manage a hotel during the overnight hours.
I did not expect a response till Monday, and yet within a couple of hours, one of their licensed realtors:  Luis Souza responded to me with targeted questions to determine my needs, affordability, location and style needs.  Needless to say, it was the beginning of what I consider as a life-long connection (most other agencies responded either a day or two days later and had only a generic response‚Ä¶)
Since that moment, and due to the unique work/life situation (working in Miami overnight and living in Ft. Lauderdale) I was only available very early during the end of the week and weekends to view apartments.  No problem for Luis.  Much to my surprise, he had sacrificed sleep and personal life for the next few weekends and would meet me early morning at work even on weekends, and line up almost all the apartments I had viewed online and had expressed interest, but after feeling out my style and preferences, he was not too afraid to redirect me and offer his expert suggestions, which helped me see the market and my choices under a new light.
His suggestions were not limited to locations only, but on how to handle offers and counter offers, coordinate and represent me to owner realtors in a way that was truly to my benefit, prioritization of needs and balance of work/life to enter the scale when it came to location, etc.  He also helped me navigate the world of escrows, applications, and lots of other standard requirements that were all very new to me.
After only a few attempts, we finally found the apartments of my dreams and now I am happily settled in my new place!
I rarely feel so strongly about services rendered, as in this day and age, many people focus on crude transactions, instead of offering personable interactions and manage to apply your life to the product or service.  Luis Souza has exceeded my expectations by far and I highly recommend him to anyone not just looking for a realtor, but a friend and an ally who will be next to them every step of the journey!
Thank you for everything Luis."

Highly Recommend these movers!

Full service movers, they bring all of the packing materials for furniture and any other items, plus floor protectors. These are full time movers, not day laborers or ad-hoc movers.

This was my family's 5th move with them, I only use them and will continue to do so as long as they service wherever I live in Texas. They are careful and considerate of mine and my family members belongings. 5 moves with so far and NOT A SINGLE ITEM HAS EVER BEEN DAMAGED.

From start to finish these guys are reliable, professional, friendly and efficient.

Taylor, Enrique and Tyrone were the movers this time. Today they moved my brother, who has Traumatic Brain Injury. They were compassionate and understood the situation, and were very respectful of the parameters involved (quiet, no sudden movements, no loud noises, any questions to be directed to me).

They set up his bed first in case of a seizure. My brother did suffer 4 episodes today in which one was so bad he passed out and broke a picture. Taylor was quick to help me get him up off the floor and onto the bed, and even cleaned up the broken glass on the floor. These guys ALWAYS go above and beyond what you expect from movers.

Enrique  and Tyrone worked diligently to get the washer and dryer installed. Due to the size of the laundry closet and the dryer on a pedestal, the washer and dryer had to swap places. They gave me a list of items I need to pick up from a hardware store to complete the set up.

They even reassembled the 3 VERY HEAVY coffee tables for my brother before they left.  This was a safety concern for me and they took care of it no questions asked.

I cannot say enough good things about Wildcat Movers."

6244,0.06476190476190477,"We were recently moved by Eco Movers and were severely disappointed with the result

1. Initially contacted us saying they would come at the end of our 4 hour window. In reality, they came an hour after that call while only giving a 15 minute heads up when they promised they would call 30 minutes in advance.

2. Arrived with a small a truck. Even though we had listed all the items for the move, they ended up needing to make two trips back and forth in order to move everything from a two bedroom apartment. This costed us both time and money since they count travel time. It's fairly obvious that minimizing costs is their top priority since they charge from the time the truck leaves their warehouse.

3. They almost left furniture inside their truck. Had we not double counted everything, they would have driven off with some of our things.

4. BROKEN FURNITURE. We specifically went with the more expensive option with hopes of better service and avoiding issues like this. This is the most basic part of moving. Don't break the furniture.

Eco movers were recommended to us, but I don't understand how they are so highly rated. It's clear that they just want to save on cost and spend more on marketing instead of spending it on the most essential part of the service, which is moving (without breaking things)"

They pretend to be very professional until the apartment leasing office pays them and they offer 2 free hours move. Then starts the melodrama. They send me two weaklings (gustavo ""the player"" and roberto ""the follower"") on the day of the move, in the morning slot while i was scheduled for the afternoon slot. they came and assessed that it will take 8 hours to move me (5 miles) when the same company moved me (15 miles) an year earlier within 3 hours including loading and unloading the same stuff. They scuffed and dented almost everything that was moved. Handled the things by kicking with their legs across the ground. They wanted money upfront for 8 hours while they were holding my stuff hostage in their old van. Bobby is the manager and he is the real player, very unprofessional and does not take responsibility at all. Apparently you are on your own negotiating with the people who come to move you. I ended up paying for 8 hours ( 2.5 hours were ""free"") to move my stuff which were all broken. They are definitely not the right movers for you. Please look elsewhere. I will definitely not recommend them even for my worst enemy"

Then when it came to the house search, he was more than willing to work around our crazy work schedules and show us homes within a day or even hours of them being on the market. He was extremely knowledgeable about potential remodel ideas, as well as potential issues that would come with the homes.

During the move, a number of mishaps occurred, but the worst was the TV that was broken by your employees. We filled out the claim and sent the papers only to be told that you would give us $38 for the damage. That is far from sufficient. I sent an email to company owner, and that fell on deaf ears. These were some of the mistakes made during the day:

1. No one was taking inventory on what was being moved;
2. When the two movers were about to take the TV in question, they looked puzzled initially but went about taking it anyway. According to the company document, they had the right to tell us they didn't want to take the TV because of the risks. That didn't happen. They took responsibility by moving it;
3. They arrived at the house at the last possible minute of their 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. window;
4. They dropped a tri-fold vanity, which broke most of the glass;
5. Garbage was dumped in front of the old house;
6. Implicit instructions were not followed about some furniture not being turned on its side;
7. When unloading boxes, they were asked to put some in a different spot than originally placed, but it took a second, third and even fourth request for them to respond;
8. Often one person, and sometimes two, was sitting in the truck when work was still to be done;
9. The floor was scuffed during the move;
10. Among the items damaged were a dresser, glasses in a box clearly marked FRAGILE, a book shelf, a light fixture;
11. Beds were put together incorrectly.

We wanted to remain civil and wanted compensation for the TV.
We contacted an official about this and voiced some of the concerns mentioned above.

I said no cancel this appointment. Then he calls me 10 minutes later to say that he'll do it for the 3 guy price. So I said fine because I really needed to be moved before 5. So they show up at 3:30pm. 4 guys I helped them move most of my stuff out of the garage with my dad because they all looked so over worked and I felt bad for them. Then they get my furniture items in the truck and ask if I need anything else. I said no lets just go because it was so late already. They get lost following me and waste time and I text the driver my address and he apparently didn't get it until days later. So I talked to him on the phone to follow me to my apartment. Finally he finds me and they start unloading my things. They put stuff everywhere, all my wood furniture was scratched. My book case had a piece missing too. So finally he wants to take the payment and he keeps asking me do you want to pay for 3 movers or 4? Like totally going against what we had agreed upon. He charged me for 4 and left. This was the most stressful move I've ever experienced. I had to move everything to the room that it needed to be in myself.

The first two times I received professional moving services, even so that I recommended another 3 clients, but most recently I wouldn‚Äôt use or recommend them any further after the last move. On move 3, my movers showed up late and to make matters worse both of the movers acted as if this was their first ever move. They damaged two of my night stands, took 4 hours to move one storage unit no larger than 300 square feet into a 3 bedroom home which was 3 miles from the storage unit and damaged the walls in my home in the process. The explanation I received was that the moving company had many jobs to do and they had to hire additional drivers and moving trucks. The movers were fresh from training. The movers showed up in a rented Uhaul truck. One guy spoke English while his helper spoke only Spanish. It was almost comical to watch except for the cringing everytime my stuff was moved. I worked as a translator to help both guys out but the process was so bad I told them to stop services and I‚Äôll move the remaining stuff in the unit myself.

4991,0.05888278388278388,"This is the 3rd time I've used movers and my 1st time with AM. Unfortunately, this move didn't go well for us. My last move was from a 3rd floor apartment and the men had to both disassemble and reassemble my large, wooden bedframe and they were responsible for protecting and moving everything. That move took 3 hours.

This time, we were on the 2nd floor (we did have some boxes stored in an upstairs area of our loft) - but all furniture was already disassembled and we put it back together ourselves. We loaded all TVs and computers and multiple other items into our cars ourselves to speed up the process. But somehow - this move took 5.25 hours.

The two men were on time and friendly and nothing was broken - I will give them that. However, I watched one of the men take multiple small trips to both load and unload. A prime example is that he carried two small pieces of wood that fit into a bookshelf as a load. I was super curious why he didn't load boxes onto a dolly and put those small pieces of wood on top. Or even carry a box in his arms with the wood pieces sitting on top of it. They weren't fragile my any means and didn't require some special care.

The men said this was their only job for the day and, after watching that one worker take multiple trips consisting of small items, I believe they were not worried at all about finishing the work quickly. Which isn't acceptable since we were being charged by the hour. It felt like they were running up the clock since they get paid by the hour.

We will not be using AM Moving again and won't be recommending them.

EDITED TO UPDATE:
I reached out to Rod on the same day that I posted my original review. He was able to locate us in his records through my husband's name and asked what he could do to make the situation better, which I super appreciated. After talking for a few minutes, he said he needed to confirm with the owner of the business and he would call me back in 5 minutes. It has been 13 days now and I still haven't heard back.

His crew came on time and worked all day moving everything out and didn't stop for even a lunch break. We ended up adding a second location as we needed to put some things in storage and they went both places without giving me a hard time or charging more.

Once the truck was full we had a few items remaining in the apartment and Carlos the owner was kind enough to come the next day with his own personal truck to get the rest of the items out and to my new location. Enough can not be said about how above and beyond these guys went to making the move as less stressful as possible. They truly care. Highly recommend them. Mom and Pop operation."

At times the legs of my brand new dining table were thrown into the truck on top of the table. They did not wrap my furniture nor did they protect it as promised!  No blankets were used and no wrap was used on my couches, dining room table or appliances at all.  They left 2 things at the house and said it could not fit in truck.  Myself and my 70 yr old father had to move a chair and kitchen table.  Because they were late, my storage unit was closed and I had to spend a 2nd day moving.  On the 2nd day I noticed the damage to my things.  I mentioned the scratches and dents to the moving guys and they immediately wrapped it with a blanket, taped it up, and put it in the back of my storage unit.  The washer and dryer were also severely damaged and that was put in the back as well.  I had to take everything back out to get to it and take pictures.  They saw ALL the damaged and mentioned they could not believe it and that it was not wrapped or protected.  This company would not replace my appliances that were damaged/dented- they were all new.

I called them the next morning after making certain that my heirloom was missing and not misplaced by me. I got a response late that morning from the owner, Zane, that they would look for it and that Zane would call me back with an update before the end of the day. Fast forward and it was 4 1/2 days before I got a response. I got a response back this morning from a number with a blocked ID and it was Zane. He called to tell me that he had been on vacation and that's why he couldn't call me back even though he had committed on our last call (4 1/2 days prior) that he would. Either I was lied to or maybe it's owner apathy or incompetence, but I can't believe I highly ethical, customer focused service organization would not be concerned about a customer's concern.

No refund or monetary solutions were offered by Wildcat. I hung up with Zane with basically a we're sorry and it sucks to be you conversation.

Lastly, this was important enough to me that I went to their ""office"" in Addison and there's no markings and it was hard to find. Some might suggest it has the markings of a fly by night organization, but not me. I've posted pictures of my visit just as an FYI.

I recommend finding a company that is bonded and insured. I wish I'd used the firemen movers. Meanwhile, I've filed a report with the police. Caveat emptor."

Geoff was very knowledgeable about the local market, including local comparable properties that had recently sold and that were coming onto the market at the same time as ours. From scheduling the stagers, photographers, tours of our home, etc, Geoff was highly communicative and always responded to our questions on time.

Once the home hit the market, Geoff had advised us to do all offer reviews on the same day one week after posting, instead of reviewing the offers as they came in. This one bit of advice turned out to be the wisest counsel we got throughout the process. A comparable property that listed a few days before ours had initially sought to review offers as they came in, then changed to reviewing offers on the same day as our reviews. During this process, the comp ended up accepting an offer before their review date, but Geoff advised us to stick to our schedule and review all offers on the same day.

Long story short, the comp sold for 30K above asking just a few days ago. Our home sold for 60K above asking and closed three weeks ahead of time! Thanks to Geoff and his associate Tiarrah for their help!"

They arrived at 11:06. He proceeded to tell me that he don't know what I was told but he was told to arrive between 10:30 and noon. He then looked around and said the move would take 4 hours. I said this is not a 4 hour move. He argued until I agreed to 3 hours. There was a lot of going back and forth with this guy until the move was over. It  took him 35 minutes to make a 15 minute drive from my apartment to my new place. When called and asked if he was lost he said he'd be there in 3 minutes which took an additional 10 minutes.  I think he deliberately waisted time to make sure he was there only 3 hours. When he finished unloading which was right at 3 hours he refused to put my bed up which I was told was part of the move when I placed my order. He said he would put it up only if I paid for additional time which I wasn't about to do because of the time he waisted getting there. I called the office and spoke to Bobby who said this never would've happened had I not changed from 3 men to 2 men because of money. I didn't appreciate this comment and told him so. My changing from 3 men to 2 was because I had moved a lot of my things myself and only needed 2 men. It had nothing to do with money.

There were 3 movers, but 2 out of the 3 movers were on there cellphones frequently and stood around talking a lot longer than I cared for considering that we were being charged by the hour. Nevertheless, the guys were pretty fast and had the apartment packed up in just over 2 hours. 3 out of the 5 tvs that I had were left behind by the movers, because they said that company didn't want to be held liable for any scratches,  yet I was charged an additional 30.00 for packing materials. Once they reached my home, they unloaded fairly quickly. At the end of the move, I was told by one of the movers that their boss, Bobbie, said that an extra 100.00 was due for fuel charges. Before I even let this guy finish, I showed him my contract. I was aware of a 45.00 refueling charge before I signed the contract. I stated to him that the contract was legally binding and that if his boss had and any issues about what he quoted me, then give him a call and we could chat. There was no way that I was paying any additional monies. The mover then stated not to worry about it and I told him that I was not worried at all. We paid them 549.00 for our move for 5 hours with 3 guys, which was a pretty good deal, tipped them 20.00 each and that went on their way. Two days ago we finally put up all of our things and realized that we were missing 2 expensive tools, a level and some drill bits. We checked the house up and down multiple times before contacting the company, reluctantly. On August 4, 2020, I contacted their boss, Bobbie, whom set us up with the service and did not reach him directly, so I left him a voice mail about the items that were missing. It's now August 6, 2020 and I have yet to get a response from him about the theft of my tools. The 1 star given was solely given due to the speed of the move, but the lack of 5 stars was due to the unprofessionalism, attempted overcharging and theft. Now, I'm not bitter. I am upset, because if we can't trust  a professional moving company to move our things and get them from point A to point B in not only the same condition that we had them, but also assuring that all items make it off of their trucks, then who can we trust? Was I supposed to be in two places at one time to make sure that everything made it on the truck?  If you want a speedy move, these are your guys. If you want items that you have worked hard for and paid a pretty penny for to vanish into thin air with no accountability nor responsibility from the people people that moved you, then I suggest you find a more trustworthy and reputable company.

One of the movers lifted the furniture and twisted it on one corner to place onto the dolly. It was clear that using that method would create a bald spot in the carpet area. My apartment charged me $549 to replace the carpet in that bedroom!

I have moved with AB Moving before and our prior experience was different. I booked 2 movers, they showed up with 3 and did not charge me extra. The movers were very professional and used iPads to document time, photos of furniture, damage, and payment. One of the movers ended up being a little rough with our furniture and damaged a desk and a dresser drawer became non-functional and stuck after the move. The supervisor was extremely apologetic and noted the damages, told me to file the claim ASAP and they would take care of it. I honestly didn‚Äôt go out of my way to do so because I couldn‚Äôt be mad at them after being so professional so I made it super
low priority. I have referred friends to them and was extremely happy with the customer service and friendliness of the moving crew. We were expecting this level of customer service again.

During this move, actually out of the apartment they moved us into, we were made aware that one of the movers worked directly with AB moving and the other mover was a contractor for AB moving (as he stated). No pre-inspection of the apartment was done, no documentation, no iPad, didn‚Äôt even sign anything before or after, and even had us make a payment over the phone with a manager after the move. Really weird experience. There was only one thing brought to our attention during the move: A loose leg for the living room couch, which we were already aware of. During the move, granted we lived down a very long hallway, the movers were less than friendly and were very passive aggressive after bringing the damage to their attention. In addition to all of this, as soon as they completed the move to the storage unit, they immediately started an impromptu move with a random lady at the storage place after she asked how much they would charge to help her.

The level of professionalism is incomparable between the two moves and I'm extremely upset that our customer claim is being handled this way. My move was $395 but ended up costing me almost $1,000!!! I understand things happen and moves aren‚Äôt 100% perfect. I have been reasonable and patient, but that has worn out after zero contact back from John. Customer service/experience should be top priority for anyone in the service industry and not swept under the rug. I have been seeking reimbursement for the carpet replacement ($549). I just wanted this resolved from the start."

They did not have tools readily available to take apart furniture. As a matter of fact, they had to buy tools that took more time to get started.

There were only two guys working, and when one is shopping for tools and the clock is running, the customer pays in the long run.

They did work hard once they got started. They were very polite and were professional even after they realized we were not happy.

There was not much furniture, and they continuously told me there wasn't that much furniture, so why  took a little more than 21/2 hours to load the truck was rather frustrating.

I could tell Victor was getting frustrated, but he did keep his cool by not venting. I greatly appreciated their hard work, but taking 5 hours seems like they were milking the clock.

The five star rating was the reason we chose the company. I am a first time homeowner and this is my partners second home.  Kim received a $12,000 commission without doing anything (well she completed the paperwork) and she is all about the sale and not about what‚Äôs best for the customer. Kim didn‚Äôt find us the home, we found it ourselves. We provided our criteria, she took us out once in a vehicle that was less than ideal covered in dog hair with a really bad odor to see homes, but she didn‚Äôt seem to understand what we wanted. Getting a hold of Kim was next to impossible. The only thing she showed up for was the inspection beyond that we never saw her, she didn‚Äôt come to the closing or help with anything to get questions answered from her I often had to be firm and tell her we were going to back out of the deal and of course she responded then. We were so consumed by wanting the home and the fear of losing the home because there were multiple offers that we allowed this women to have the commission otherwise we would have fired her! If you‚Äôre looking for a professional realtor that is concerned about what‚Äôs best for you and providing a positive experience I would highly advise that you go somewhere else.

5699,0.038603896103896106,"I recently used Lazy Bear Moving Company for my relocation from a second-floor apartment to a townhome with stairs. Overall, the experience was satisfactory, but there were some notable drawbacks.

The majority of my furniture was wrapped for protection during transit, but unfortunately, my table was not, resulting in damage and scraped paint. Although I managed to remove the paint, the chips and scratches remain unfixable. Additionally, my dresser, despite being wrapped, incurred damage to the bottom right corner.

Communication with Carlos, the owner, was initially promising. However, despite my request for assistance in bringing boxes to the second floor, as agreed upon with Carlos, the movers did not fulfill this commitment. Instead, they opted to leave the boxes in the living room, disregarding the labeled instructions for room placement. I was under the impression that moving companies place boxes in the rooms in which they belong in.

Throughout the move, I noticed a team member who seemed to express dissatisfaction through facial expressions, which gave the impression that he found the job challenging. I do agree that this move was complicated as we were moving from an apartment located on the second floor to a two-story townhome. My partner, and his friend assisted with moving heavy boxes to the new place.

Despite these setbacks, I am grateful for the assistance provided, especially considering past difficulties during moves. Despite a language barrier, I made efforts to be accommodating, offering food, drinks, and a tip to the movers.

Carlos demonstrated attentiveness by checking in on the progress of the move, which was appreciated. He even upgraded the move free of charge. I appreciate the assistance provided, though I had higher expectations for the overall experience."

Something else that struck is one of the guys on the crew also moved me into the the apartment I moved out of... 3 years ago! Also every time I called I spoke directly with a person and it was always a pleasure. I would definitely recommend you use Phoenix to move your stuff, 100%."
4888,0.03672226466344115,"After hours of scoring movers and reading countless reviews I settled on Wild cat movers in spite of their higher rates due to their promise of ‚Äòexpert efficient movers and  red carpet service‚Äô. I thought $139 was a bit steep but I have used bargain movers before and regretted it. you get what you pay for right? Not so.
I was quoted $139 an hour and told that the estimated time to move my 1 bedroom apt was approx 2.5 hrs. I was told there‚Äôs a 2 hr minimum. When Daniel called me to schedule, I asked that he email me an estimate stating such and he basically sent me an email w the rates and 2 hr min. I did notice there was no estimated amount of time as we had discussed , so when I called back to book, we reviewed the time frame and set time to complete again. Ultimately, the move was scheduled for 2/26/21 with an arrival window of 1-3 pm, my expectation was that the job be completed in approx 2.5 hrs.
Due to the power outages in my area from the snowstorm, I had been unable to completely pack my apartment. I figured we‚Äôd hit the 2 hour min but didn‚Äôt anticipate much beyond that. I had donated my sofa and did not expect the movers to move with any areas that had not been packed. This left the boxes that were packed and stacked up ready to go, and my heavy furniture that I can not move myself. Not included: The closet, the bathroom and a portion of my kitchen. (I planned completing those on my own, but was hoping for help w the closet if possible)
The day of the move 3 pm came and went with no word from the movers, at 3:30 I reached out to Daniel who looked up the location of the truck and told me he was going to reach out to the team and find out what was going on, moments later he called back and said there had been an issue w a washer/ dryer at the previous location and the new ETA was 4:15 latest. He stated this was not usual for them and that all he could do was apologize.
The new ETA, 4:15 pm came and went , at 5:30 I called to follow up and was unable to get anyone on the phone, according to the published hours they are open until 6 pm.
Finally I get a call from the movers stating they are finished w the previous move and are on their way and asking if that still works for me. I told them I wasn‚Äôt sure what they were asking as I had hired one mover and did not have a plan B. They said they didn‚Äôt understand the question. Me: are you offering to reschedule? Will this move be completed in a timely manner? You are 3 hours late, will I be compensated in some way? They responded I‚Äôd have to work that out with Daniel- Daniel who gave me a completely incorrect ETA and who refuses to answer the phone? Great. They assured me I‚Äôd be taken care of and were on the way.
When the movers arrived they were visibly exhausted, I told them I was upset but no good would come of screaming and shouting and I needed this done as quickly as possible. I asked Ryan the lead mover for a realistic estimated time to complete the load and he said approx 1.5 hrs, prob less to unload. I was ok with 3 hrs to complete the move and we proceeded. My move time started at 5:48 pm.
The move was completed at 10:30 PM, in addition, my items were damaged and the movers were not efficient. I was given excuses such as the 2nd mover was new, it was ‚Äúa bad day at the office‚Äù and told that I shouldn‚Äôt be offered any compensation because they were late because they were ‚Äúdoing their job‚Äù and had to move a washer dryer up to a third floor. At $139 an hr, none of these are acceptable.
Upon loading not only did I observe my items being dropped, but I also pointed out that my nightstand had been damaged. Ryan begin to get defensive and claimed it was already damaged, after I informed him the nightstand was purchased new and had never been moved he tried to get me to sign a Pad Wrap release of Liability. I declined. At this point he tried to reach out to Daniel, as did I and of course nether of us got an answer.
After all of this when Zane the owner reached out he offered to reimburse me for 45 min of time. I Told him that was not acceptable."

I booked Pure for a standard 1 bedroom move job between locations less than 30 minutes apart.  Do not believe that the fee is flat as in the end all sorts of strange fees are added to the final bill as they charge traffic fee, double charges, whatever they can nickel and dime from you.  It took these movers 8 hours to complete the move.  They could not have been any slower as I observed the movers carry small pieces on each trip prolonging the time they can charge to customers.  For this simple 1 bedroom move, the final charge was nearly 1,400 dollars for 8 hours.

I will say the moving job was fine and nothing was damaged, but the billing is not as straightforward as advertised.

In my experience this was a con job and I like to share this so others are careful in doing business with this company."

We thought AB Moving saved the day even though they charged us 3 times the price since it was last minute but after they did our move that day I noticed that one of my handguns that I keep under our master bed was missing.  I called the manager who helped us move that day and he said maybe I packed it.  I spent a week going through every box to make sure it wasn't packed even though I know I didn't pack it.  I never found it.  Their mowers made me feel like I was in the way so I went into another bedroom with my dogs to calm them down while they did our master bedroom.  Little did I know they would steal my firearm that cost $700.  I spent weeks talking to customer service and a manager at AB Moving trying to resolve the issue, filled a stolen firearm report with the Dallas Police Dept.  Long story short after following up with them for 2 months their initial offer was based on the weight of the stolen items, they offered me $25 and for me not to complain about it publicly, see their email offer below:

We have reviewed your claim and would like to offer you $25.00 back from your move as settlement.

1.	Springfield pistol ‚Äì 4 LBS
2.	Springfield gun case ‚Äì 3 LBS
3.	Holster ‚Äì 1 LB

This offer was based on the coverage of cargo liability provided on your quote. Information is included in your Contract for moving services.
We have attached the contract for moving service. Coverage information is located on page 1.

It is stated on estimate and was sent out a couple of time prior to move date that we do not handle/transport firearms.

Please complete attached Release form and provide the last 4 digits of the card you used with us and we will refund this card.

In response to this email is acknowledgment that the carrier and its agents are discharged from any and all future claims, law suits, complaints of any nature pertaining to this claim.

I told them this was completely unacceptable, someone stole a FIREARM from my house and knows where I live.  They then offered me $100.

Aweful service, I cant believe movers would have the nerves to steal a loaded firearm from someones house and then management would have the nerve to address it with an offer of a $25 refund.  Will never use or recommend them again."

The problem is that friendliness escalated to sexual harassment by the end of the day. One of the last things he said to me was if you don't have a place to sit, you can sit on my face.

You may ask why I didn't immediately call the company and tell them to get him out of there. 1. I was moving and by the time the friendliness have gotten to the point where I was uncomfortable, they had all my stuff.
2. I was friendly,  I laughed at bad jokes. I joked back.
So he would say I was playing along. So I just wanted to get myself moved.
3. By the end, I was not friendly. When he told the other mover to go to the truck and leave us there, that man looked at me and I shook my head ""no"". So he knew I was not happy and he did not leave. But he didn't say anything. Which means the harasser knew I wanted it to stop.

I requested a discount to address the inconvenience, but was informed that only the manager could approve such a discount. Despite my numerous attempts to reach the manager, it has been impossible to get in touch. It's now October 27th, and I've made more than 10 contact attempts without resolution.

The discrepancy between their claimed 4.9-star rating and the actual service provided is perplexing. While they emphasize their commitment to customer satisfaction, it seems that once payment is received, their level of service falls short. Notably, I had paid extra to ensure a seamless moving experience, but instead, I encountered unreliability.

Movers showed up on time, I felt they were efficient with their time, until it was time to leave. Once everything was out and they let me know, it took them about 30 minutes to actually leave, I will say that they didn't calculate that time into my final amount. There was no damage to my furniture, but  handful of scuff makes on the walls carrying they furniture up the stairs. One mover was nice enough to setup my washer and dryer also. Now the reasons I removed 2 stars, while one mover was disassembling my bed, I specifically gave him a bag to put the screws in, and when it came time for them to put the bed back together, he had half the screws and proceeds to tell me that was all that was on the set, which I knew was a lie and was confirmed when I went back to finish cleaning up my apartment and found half the screws on my bedroom floor, since the bed was put together by the company I purchased it from, so he ran to the truck and put some other screws in that were the wrong size as they stuck out the bottom of the wood. Then when my bed needed to moved so I could paint, it was falling apart since the screws were not the correct size.  Also I had some packaged water bottles go missing, wouldn't have minded them being taken, if permission was granted.

On the day of the move, the driver did a walk through (which is standard) but it appears that once he realized that we wouldn't need more than 5 hours to move our things, he began to say that I needed to have our couches wrapped. I've moved several times in my life and I've never wrapped a couch. I could understand if we had large bulky couches that had wood on the arms or the base of the couch to prevent chipping. But we had modern style couches based on the them of our condo. We already prewrapped our dressers, night stands and TV stand with our own shrink wrap. We literally only had boxes, a dinning room table, two beds, two couches and night stands. The rest of our home was boxes. We had them organized in one room of the home to minimize the time. We understood the 2 hour minimum which we would have met and maybe gone over an extra hour for travel time. When we declined the wrapping of our couch and dinning room table, it became a problem. He told my husband and I that he would need to call the office to find out what to do. Well we waited, and waited, and waited for him to return. After about 15 minutes my husband went to see what was going on and the driver left! We called the office to find out what was going on and we were under the impression that to wrap our table and couches was requirement because that is what we were told. To wrap these items would have added more time that was not necessary. We found out from Tre in customer service that the driver left because he did not feel comfortable with moving our furniture unwrapped. Guys, we have basic apartment furniture. Nothing expensive at all. We later find out from Trey that the policy is that we can sign a waiver to not have it wrapped which we would have gladly signed. Because the furniture wasn't a big deal. But to just leave us hanging on the day of our move without saying anything was flat out wrong. It all boiled down to the fact that this guy wasn't going to get paid what he wanted to get paid because it was probably considered a ""small job."" Not to mention, when we tried to call him back to find out what was going on, he would never pick up the phone or answer our call. To be transparent, we did send him an unpleasant text message way later after we found out from customer service that he ditched us and left us scrambling to find another moving company. I will never use AB Moving again. They are not reliable and they will try and get as many hours from you as possible. And I didnt even get an apology. I think that is what also sucks because as a customer I'm stuck to figure things out and they had no solution and didnt even care that their driver left us hanging."

Albuquerque, NM.
5 days later I sent a customer service email noting no one had ever contacted me and they were over 120 hours late based on the initial contact ;) They assured me someone would reach out - no one ever did. Two days later I received a message from the same customer service agent asking if ""I needed any further assistance and to let them know if I had any more questions"", to which I responded ""I haven't had anyone reach out to me in any way about selling our place, so really the only assistance I have had to this point at all, is you responding to my initial customer service message that no one had ever contacted me in the first place."" Jeeeeeezus...
Two days later the same customer service agent contacts me noting they never received that initial contact from me - to which I responded by forwarding her the confirmation message from the first day - see above. Embarrassing.
5 minutes later I get a call from an agent, but can't answer as I am on a work call.

9609,0.015848997493734335,"Hired Pure Moving for relocating from a one-bedroom condo to another one-bedroom apartment. It took the three men crew 12 hours to complete the job @$179/hr.  Despite all that time, I found several boxes where they tossed the stuff into the box resulting in damages.  Not a competent work.

Paid $250 for ‚Äúfull unlimited packing kit.‚Äù  Despite that, not everything, including glass items, were wrapped.  Also, I expected some bubble wrap for fragile items, but no, it was paper wrap only.  So, there were a number of damaged items.  Also, they did not wash their hands or wear gloves before handling my kitchen items.  They ended up filthy!

During the move, the crew assumed that the cable box in the condo belong to the condo association, so they left it.   They never asked me about it!   So, they had to go back and get the box, so they could test the TV, per their policy.  They also damaged DVD cabinet.

At the end, I paid with a credit card.  Their payment system ‚Äúsuggested ‚Äú a tip, 10/15/20 %.  On $ 2,500 service?!?  What audacity!  I refused.  They visibly showed anger.  I also told them, at best it would be a 4-start rating (this was before I found damages and sloppy work).

All in all, this was a frustrating experience.  The wait, the damages, filth.
I cannot believe that Pure Moving sent a crew that apparently was not trained well and had little experience in moving business.

Yes, I did complain.  I sent them photos.  They apologized and refunded me $700.
But disappointment and anger remains.
I cannot and will not recommend Pure Moving.

Jan 23, 2024 (amendment):
As soon as above review posted, I got a call from Pure Moving.  They, essentially, offered me additional refund if I would ‚Äúup‚Äù my rating/review.  I declined, initially.  But, having their staff tell me it should not have been more than 6 hours for this one-bedroom move and reading other reviews that criticized Pure Moving for its excessive time (one complaining that it was too much at 3 hours) , I decided to accept the additional refund.  However, I told them even with any further refund (I suggested $400), I will NOT change my rating/review.  Unsurprisingly, I have not received more refund or any further contact from them.  I would also say that I have HUGE concern about their numerous high ratings.  Is it truly their ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù work?  Or is it that subsequent refund offer may have persuaded others to up their review/rating."
1495,0.015204081632653053,Had some damage on a couple of expensive things but I addressed it with their management and they made it right. The movers did try to cover it up by setting something on top of the damage so I wouldn't notice it right away. They also tried to blame it on my dogs scratching the table which was really frustrating because the gash was very long and deep.
4183,0.01501047178130511,"I booked with exodus moving company in March of 2021 for an in-state local move into a storage unit. To clarify I booked for packing as well as moving and unloading my stuff into storage so there was no unpacking or assembly involved.  I was told the packing would take 2hrs and moving it into the truck and unloading in the storage unit which was 15 mins away approximately 3.5hrs at 120/hr. I was told the supplies would cost an additional $233 and $120 for the truck. So, I was given a total quote for $700 for moving a 2bed room condo, which might as well not have been given to me because it was completely off. Going by the above numbers the initial quote should have been for $950, so this goes to show that they give you wrong quotes to begin with on purpose to get you to book with them or they don‚Äôt know how to give right estimates because of lack of experience. I eventually got a bill for $1400 and it took them 9hrs to complete the whole thing!! 9 vs. 5.5!! Almost double the amount of time. When I got the bill I called to enquire what happened and why were the estimates so off l. The owner gets on the phone keeps talking over me, cutting me off and tries to mock me for expecting that the estimates would be that low something that they gave me, very unprofessional!!! Will never use their service ever again and strongly advice you to avoid them as well.

Bottom line: they give you wrong quotes and estimates are kept low either on purpose to get you to book with them or due to lack of experience. Either way you‚Äôre better off going with a company that is reliable,  has been doing this long, therefore gives you right estimates at the beginning itself and then tries hard to stick to those targets, and in the rare case that they don‚Äôt at least they won‚Äôt mock you over the phone.

Per usual, we had higher hopes for how prepared we‚Äôd be BEFORE movers arrived, and failed. They were courteous and patient, and helped where needed.

To boot, we have a massive bunkbed where each piece weighs 30-60 pounds (depending on the size), and they tackled it plus our entire, over-stuffed space in just 2 hours over the original estimate which didn‚Äôt include the bunkbed because I said we‚Äôd have it disassembled‚Äîoops. They‚Äôre masters of their work, and I‚Äôm so grateful for them.

For our second move in Seattle, I‚Äôd forgotten their company name and used another moving company which happened to be $80/hour~ less expensive. They broke our couch, the kids‚Äô original bunkbed, our entertainment unit, etc., and would take regular 30-minute breaks without notice, on the clock.

4797,0.007992260264987535,"CONSUMER BEWARE!  I never write reviews but in this case it's necessary.  This company is a scam.  Their employee Albert will provide you with a low estimate only to get your business.  He'll even advise you to search for reviews online (which are most likely provided by himself, employees or friends of Albert).  Movers arrived in a Budget truck and plain clothes (not the logo Truck or tee-shirts shown on the internet).  I moved out of an 800 sq. ft. 1 bedroom apartment to my new location (less than a 7 min. drive).  I packed my own belongings.  Albert advised since my apartment was fairly small and I had basic furniture for a 1 bedroom apartment the move would probably take approximately 3.5 hrs with 2 men and a truck.  The men moved slowly (i.e.  moving 1 small box in some cases at a time).  I assisted with the move and had to call a friend to assist due to the excessive amount of time these movers spent moving my belongings; it took them 3 hrs just to move the items out of my bedroom.  In addition the Budget truck was not able to fit all my belongings which resulted in 2 trips!  The move ended up taking 6.5 hrs (almost double the time-frame initially mentioned by Albert) and I still had to go back to my previous residence the next day to move the rest of my belongings!  I expressed my frustration to Albert while the move was occurring and when the movers completed the job but of course since this company's a scam Albert insisted on payment for the excessive amount of time.

Things to look out for with moving companies that aren't legitimate:  companies that do not come out to inspect your property prior to scheduled move to provide an accurate estimate, companies that request/ ""prefer"" cash payment, companies that don't have a fleet of vans/ trucks with company logo (if you run a google search you should be able to see vans/ trucks outside the provided company address), generic answers to phone call instead of a company greeting, false addresses (if you search the internet this company has several listed addresses including on their own website).

7762,0.006617647058823535,"The worst experience ever.
1. Our recent move, focused only on moving furniture from a two-bedroom apartment (no boxes), turned into a major ordeal. Loading took an unexpected 4 hours, costing us double the initial estimate. Despite the short 10-minute drive between places, it took a whopping 9 hours in total ‚Äì nearly as much as a cross-country move. The final cost was way higher than expected, and frankly, it's just not reasonable.
2. On top of that, the crew members were unprofessional. They kept asking personal questions unrelated to the move, making us feel really uneasy."
9424,0.006249999999999999,"Extremely professional and careful. Mauricio F., Segundo, and Ruben were efficient and worked well in a difficult building. We hired them to pack our POD for a cross-country move. We were very grateful that we did because it was questionable if everything was going to fit. They packed it very efficiently and our things arrived undamaged. Would absolutely recommend!"
1384,0.006249999999999999,"Update: Customer service handled the issue. Seems like I got unlucky with the movers, but the company handled it well.

Original review: Extremely slow and disappointing from start to finish. Took significantly longer than the last time I moved this same furniture, all while I'm getting billed $170 hourly. They looked like they were giving a solid 40% effort the whole way through. The movers themselves estimated the job would take 3 hours after looking around the apartment. And then they took SIX HOURS. I would never use this moving company again."
8438,0.006200396825396821,"Mauricio, Erasmo, Josoi, Marvin, and Segundo were an absolute delight. They arrived 10 minutes early and immediately got to work carefully wrapping furniture and larger items in blankets and plastic wrap and hauling everything out to the truck. They were efficient and professional, and had fun while doing it. They moved super heavy furniture and an adjustable bedframe down a tight staircase in my townhouse without breaking a sweat. I was a bit surprised how much plastic wrap was used, given the environmental focus of the company, but perhaps that unavoidable. The move was completed in about 6 hours, and nothing was broken or misplaced. They ensured that each item went to the room and location I wanted. Would definitely recommend this company for your next move!"
2517,0.005867346938775509,"Although the work is done in a timely manner the movers contracted to wrightway do not pay attention to customers belongings. They managed to tear up my bed, I have tape adhesive I have to figure out how to get removed off of white leather. I have a $10,000 stereo system that was moved and they stacked so much weight in boxes that are so heavily reinforced, that the boxes started to collapse (see attached pictures). I specified to them to use moving blankets I purchased certain for furniture which was white leather, and they chose to ignore my request and they instead chose to wrap things that did not need to be. One of those things also damaged extensively is my sons crib which they chose to use as a wall to hold things from shifting in transit. What makes matters worse is that I also tipped the two men $80. It aggrevates me knowing so called ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù are so careless. I used to professionally move, and I nor my crews ever disregarded fragile markings on boxes. I went so far to purchase stickers on boxes to help ensure careful handling. They completely disregarded the stickers, but also disregarded boxes marked as ‚Äúdo not stack on top of‚Äù boxes. Many of these fragile boxes had heavier boxes stacked on top with some of the contents of the boxes being wine glasses, china and other collectible things. Your company is fortunate that I moved out of state and some things are packed in storage which may be damaged. The worst thing to mention is that I was left to work an additional 5 hours to complete the move since they left us before all are belongings were loaded. Nothing is worse than hiring movers which leave you without completing work. Beware that this company contracts out its moving services to other so called movers, or I‚Äôll call em good ol boy companies which would leave you with the experience I had. I do not recommend this company until they vet the companies they contract work to."
8219,0.005468750000000002,"Horrible! Do NOT use this company! Zero stars!

Let me start by saying that I did not book with this company but Kevin with AB Moving Company is who showed up to service our move. Apparently this was a sub-contract from the original moving company I booked with. That alone seems very deceitful but I‚Äôll continue. Our move was a very stressful move because domestic violence was involved. I was upfront and honest about the situation, my need for discretion and a little flexibility. All things were agreed upon. My unload time was scheduled for 1pm with a 12-1pm arrival time. When called the day of the move, I again, expressed the need for the move to happen at 1pm not before. I then subsequently delayed entry into the home until 1:30pm; agreeing to pay from our original start time. Kevin was not organized, did not have any tools or equipment that professional movers should have, and was not a good team lead for this job. As part of the agreement the moving team would have all tools need to assemble and disassemble furniture in the home. Because of his unpreparedness, he was unable to take apart pieces of furniture and remove the washing machine. He helped Keivon (our saving grace) move the couches to the U-Haul then left for 30+ minutes to purchase a wrench. Keivon, myself, and my friend loaded the bulk of the remaining items in his absence. He returned and insisted I close out my balance with him before the job was completed. He was pushy about payment the entire service time. He charged me for 3 and a half hours of service for less than 1 hour and a half of work. I paid him $400 dollars after he followed me to an ATM because Zelle and CashApp both have him flagged as ‚ÄúScam‚Äù and would not let me complete payment. I later found out that I was not supposed to pay him directly and he was inappropriate for harassing me before the job was completed. Justin, from the company I booked with, profusely apologize and insisted that payment should have went through him. Kevin is a scam artist, extremely lazy, and smelt strongly of weed. Moving a total of 3 items from our home. Keivon was amazing and hard working! He deserved payment for the entire job!!! Someone needs to hire him because I hope he does not continue working for this crooked company! I should add Kevin kept all but $36 which he paid to Keivon. Why? How? I‚Äôm still trying to figure this out.

If you‚Äôve made it this far into my review‚Ä¶.. please RUN!!!"
4425,0.004924242424242439,"Let me start by saying, I have used this company several times. It was not all bad, depending on the team you use or the team that is assigned to you.

My last move with them was a team of 3 people. They seemed fine at first. But the one employee Angel, kept asking me for my own blankets so he can wrap my desk, tv, stuff, etc. When I thought the company offered wraps and blankets with the move, which was included. He kept making a big deal out of it, when I was already stressed out enough. Then he kept trying to push for two trips to complete my job, when one trip would‚Äôve sufficed, if we placed everything in the truck correctly. After loading my things, the team went to lunch, and that‚Äôs fine because everyone needs to eat.

I believe they took about 45-50 minutes for lunch, at the end of the move, he rang me up and told me I owed 5 hours or so worth of work. I then asked him ‚Äúif the time taken for lunch was included?‚Äù Angel then replied, we charge you for the drive back and forth, so I will remove 30 minutes from our lunch. The whole point is, why didn‚Äôt he remove it from the beginning? Was he just going to slide their extra lunch time onto my tab, if I did not mention it? That is $149 per hour plus tax. That is quite dishonest!

After the move, I noticed there was damage in my apartment sliding mirror. I was then sent a $400 bill for this, so I called AB moving to report this. This Angel person, then called my personal line and threatened me. ‚ÄúWe did not do this, it‚Äôs our word against yours.‚Äù He kept saying this, and then I asked him ‚Äúwhy is he calling me?‚Äù This claims is made with the moving company and myself. At that point I felt threatened.

Again not all the movers are bad. It‚Äôs just some of them get greedy and want to charge you for their lunch breaks and want to push for several trips, when moving itself is already an expensive process.

I would recommend you don‚Äôt sign any paperwork the movers give you, until you check everything for damage. AB moving company closed my case and will not pay for any of my damages. This was the whole point of using a a big moving company with insurance."

Please do-not buy or sell your home through an agent named ""Ann Marie Rigali"". She is the most crooked, unethical, rude, irrational, fraudulent person I ever had to deal with.

Alert for buyers: If Ann Marie is the seller's agent run away - PLEASE do-not bid for that home ever for your own sake. Ann Marie will use every unethical practice possible to ensure you end-up paying insane money without there being other competing offers.

Her unethical practices are not just limited to what I'm sharing, in fact she does much more fraudulent work- firstly, even after the bidding deadline is past, she would get additional bidders - by wrongly sharing inflated numbers of the highest existing bids ( this in the court of law is malpractice and a felony).

Secondly, after getting additional bids post the deadline of the offer, she would email everyone to beat the highest( again by sharing wrongly inflated highest numbers) and using the ante like buyer would walk away from the deal if you can't beat the highest .

Thirdly, she would refuse to share the second highest offer always as there wouldn‚Äôt be one closer to what she would quote.

Finally, she would write an agreement keeping some loopholes, so that her team could walk away from the offer in the event she is able to lure new buyers to fetch higher price."

6931,0.0022727272727272848,"Update: After over a year they responded to my review and asked me to contact them to work things out. I emailed them and they tried to put me through the same flow that took months to resolve, only to result in them saying no reimbursement and wasting hours of my time. After I replied to that saying I simply want to be reimbursed for the item they broke, since I paid extra for insurance and showed pictures, they ignored me and I haven't heard back... until today, because they added to their automated marketing system without my consent and are now spamming me. Just a bad company overall, I can't imagine treating customers like this. Breaking items, stealing money essentially (I paid for insurance but they refused to reimburse me), then spamming me without my consent, reaching out only to waste my time again. Not cool.

I hate to give a bad review, but in this case I feel like I was cheated and not valued as a customer, and to me ethics are the most important quality for a business.

I had a piece of furniture show up broken beyond repair, so I filed a claim (I had paid for insurance before the shipment).

It took about 3 months to get a response (after bugging them multiple times). The response: I would not be able to collect any reimbursement on it because the amount was lower than the deductible.

Summary: I paid for insurance, somebody broke my furniture, and I don't get any compensation.

I prefer good ethics and honesty. If I broke something I would pay for it. This company did not.

They worked with another partner (I shipped from overseas), so I'm not sure who is to blame for breaking my furniture but they were not helpful in helping me to recoup any settlement or figure out what happened, and often ignored me.

The 2 delivery guys were great, friendly and helpful to bring in everything."

Kent rented my storage units in HIS name and now REFUSES to meet me at the storage companies to change them over to my name. He is delinquent on making payments to my climate controlled storage unit and the storage facility cannot give me information or let me pay directly because everything is in Kent's name. I stand to lose all of my belongings.  It has been 10 months of a NIGHTMARE and it is still not over. 10/24/2022

My dealings with Kent Wallace and AM Moving Company have been an absolute nightmare. DO NOT USE THIS VENDOR! I hired them to move me, after the sale of my home in December, and to store my belongings for me until I purchased a new home. They were late every day of the move. It took 3 days instead of 2 to complete my move due to the unprofessional staff who spent hours on my lawn smoking and vaping instead of moving. The sale of my home was at risk due to this delay. One of the movers quit mid move. My furniture and art were not appropriately wrapped nor  were they accurately labeled. I was told I would be getting 2 climate controlled storage units and one non climate controlled unit. 2 of the 3 were not climate controlled and my furniture and art were not wrapped and adequately protected causing significant damage (including scratches, warping, broken glass, and tears in fabric) to valued belongings and furniture that I have spent 21 years collecting. I have been locked out of my storage units due to AM Moving company not paying fees timely. AM, however, has auto drafted double payments for storage from my account on at least 2 occasions and have still not paid the actual storage units.  I cannot get a return phone call from Kent or his son and new ""Operations Manager"" Max. I still do not have access to my things and have had no response from anyone at AM Moving despite daily calls and texts. If you care about your furnishings and valuables, please learn from my mistake, and DO NOT trust this disreputable, unreliable company!"

You cannot beat the quality of service for the price with Wildcat Movers."
9379,-4.625929269271485e-18,This was our first time using Wildcat Movers. It said we would be getting 3 movers but instead we got 1 mover and a trainee. The trainee had no clue what to do. My husband had to provide him guidance. We lived in a 2 bdrm apartment. My husband moved 90% of our things in to the garage to make things easier. They still took 3.5 hours not including the drive time. I paid over $500 for 1.5 persons who were slow. We have used movers in the past and this is by far the slowest service. The only thing I appreciated was they did bring tools and materials with them to help cover stuff etc. We will not be using this company again.

Three fourths of the way thru, they tell me they are out of space in their 26-foot van! Their solution? Make another trip! The foreman said that was the largest van they have...so I guess they don't move anything larger than a one bedroom apartment (and good luck with that).  My hunch is that they just loaded very inefficiently. I spent the next two days moving the rest of my things in a van I had to rent from U-Haul. And now that the move is over, I am finding chips on my bedroom furniture, picture frames, etc. Maybe others have had better crews, but mine was not up to the job."

I only had 1 heavy item that my friends and I had already taken down (bunkbed). Mattresses were off, boxes packed and ready to move as well my tvs and mounts already being down, and 3 bar stools.  I had to pack my boxes in my friends cars because they were deliberately moving slow. One of the crew members even asked my friend to hand him my items. My friend responded with, ‚Äúyou have to give me half of your earnings if I hand you items.‚Äù The guy mugged my friend!

5932,-0.001260504201680671,"DO NOT USE THIS MOVING COMPANY. The movers showed up without proper tools. It took 3 men over an hour to take a bed apart, and they charge by the hour. As you can see in the images, they broke a dining chair and our coffee table. They also forgot to grab one of the large pieces to our bed. We had to drive all the way back to Plano from East Dallas, retrieve the part, and finish assembling the bed on our own. And, once you try to reach them after your move, they provide zero help. Do not waste your money with this company, unless you want to be over charged and receive broken items.

UPDATE: It has been more than 2 months since we moved and more than 2 weeks since they removed the broken items from our home to be ""repaired.' They have not responded to any communications and slammed the table into our wall when the took it for repairs. Now, we have no chair, no table and a large dent in our wall.

FINAL UPDATE: I called the repair man to see what was taking so long, and he informed me that the moving company told him not to work on our broken items because I left them a bad review online. The repair company began to fix the items after our call and returned them a few weeks later. DO NOT USE THIS MOVING COMPANY."

11106,-0.0032407407407407376,"Bill Plavsic of Bella Investments LLC of Hoffman Estates, IL, a franchise of HomeVestors of America (AKA ‚ÄúWe Buy Ugly Houses‚Äù), whose CEO is Larry Goodman, formerly David Hicks, made a cash offer to buy my house. I wanted to sell to a cash buyer/rehabber because my house needed a lot of work. Bill Plavsic told me the house needed at least $120,000 worth of work.

He also told me that the house didn't have a market value of $386,000, as indicated in the property assessment (once repaired), or $390,000 to $400,000 according to comparables told to me by real estate agents, because the real estate market was in decline due to a slowing economy and increasing interest rates, causing fewer buyers having affordability to buy homes. So, he offered $225,000, telling me that is the best I could get. Bill later sold my house for $430,000!

If that wasn't bad enough, although the HomeVestors ads say the seller doesn't pay closing costs, he stuck me with closing costs. I didn't realize at the time what HomeVestors's policy was on closing costs.

Bill had a garage door repair service come to the house while I was still living at the property, to repair the broken garage door springs, without informing me first when they will come to do the work, after I specifically asked him to first inform me when they were coming, because I wanted to be there to make sure they wouldn't take anything of mine from the garage. He had them come to the property the very next day without informing me. I discovered later that day my lawnmower was gone.

When I informed Bill of the theft, he said that's what happens when you leave the service door unlocked. He knew the door was unlocked! That's how he told the garage door guys to get in the garage to do the work! I asked him to contact the garage door contractor to return my lawnmower, but he never did. I told him that he should have been there to supervise their work, especially if I was not home. He never responded.

I asked Bill who the contractor is, so I can call him myself to return my lawnmower, but he refused to tell me who it is. I then told Bill that I want him to compensate me for my loss, and to pay me $300, but he refused. He refused my repeated requests.

Bill Plavsic, Bella Investments LLC of Hoffman Estates, IL, franchise of HomeVesters of America, took advantage of me, a 74 year old retiree, by lowballing me, sticking me with closing costs, and refusing to accept responsibility for my stolen lawnmower.

I observed the roofers Bill hired, and I saw that they installed cheap ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù non-architectural grade asphalt shingles, compared to architectural fiberglass shingles. So, he could spend as little as possible on the roof replacement rather than installing a higher quality roofing material. He left mold under the replacement roof, and other examples of shoddy workmanship.

My advice is to not do business with:  Bill Plavsic,  Bella Investments LLC of Hoffman Estates, IL, or HomeVestors of America (AKA ‚ÄúWe Buy Ugly Houses‚Äù)."

2574,-0.004043447871572868,"My roommate and I used AM's services about a month ago to move out of our respective apartments into a two-bedroom apartment about a mile away from our original locations. At my old apartment, after they asked me how much my apartment cost (completely unprofessional) our movers got into a fight with another moving company moving people into the building. I don't know the situation that caused the tension, but I do know that the team leader of our movers didn't handle the situation professionally whatsoever. He told the other movers to ""Come at him bro"" and got in their faces. Meanwhile, I am right next to them and honestly very uncomfortable. My roommate and I are two young girls and were put in the middle of a situation between grown men that was scary to be around. Our team could have easily been professionals and moved past the situation. What was more frustrating was after we mentioned this situation to the company, they defending the guys saying that ""the other guys were being jerks."" This is a service business and you put us in a dangerous, uncomfortable situation and told us that we had no right to feel uncomfortable. Not right.

The team was being paid hourly. They arrived at our location 30 minutes after us (keep in mind it was a 4-minute drive from the old apartment) having gotten food. I completely understand needing to eat, but we were charged for that time. In addition, the team lead was asking us questions about our favorite drinks and if we were going to have a party etc. which we found very unprofessional and a bit uncomfortable as well.

Following the move, I turned on the TV to discover that it had been destroyed and was completely unwatchable. I immediately called their number and Joe answered. He told me to send him pictures and upon viewing them he said that this situation was completely unacceptable and that he would refund me a 10% off discount for the inconvenience of the damage and because our move was longer than expected. He also promised to pay for a new TV to replace the damaged one. I was pleased with the great customer service and calmed by the solution to the very frustrating issue. Joe told me to email Rod, their office manager, and he would get it all sorted out on Monday.

I didn't receive a response back via email so I called the office to speak to Rod. I didn't hear back throughout the day, prompting me to call a second time. I received a callback hours later and spoke to Rod. When I told him of the compensation I had been told I would receive for the damage, he began getting very aggressive with me, telling me ""that's not how it works!"" and then telling me that I shouldn't have felt uncomfortable with the fight at my old building and that it was the other moving company's fault. When I told him in more detail what happened, he just said that he didn't believe me. He told me he would check back with the team but that it would take days to finalize the ""proposal"" to compensate me for the damaged TV, regardless of what I was promised. He said he would call me back the next day.

I followed up every day for about a week and finally, I received a callback. Rod asked me who promised me a 10% discount and a new TV. I told him it was Joe. He said, ""Joe is sitting right here next to me and he says he never told you that."" What began next was Joe LYING and him and Rod trying to gaslight me, because I am a young woman who they thought they could trick or pressure into backing down. Unfortunately for them, I won't be gaslit and I refused to be treated as such. Ultimately, after weeks of back and forth, they agreed to honor the discount and I found a cheaper version of the same TV they paid for (instead of the refurbished, used TV they wanted to give me).

There is more that happened that Google won't allow me to post due to character limit. Bottom line - We were treated extremely unfairly by a group of men who realized they messed up and were trying to cover their tracks, because they thought they could outsmart a couple of young women. They were aggressive and unkind."

Constant swearing the whole time the movers were moving boxes. At one point I was told my bed frame was going to not be able to be taken through the door which caused both movers to get into yet another argument. Once arriving to my new place my leather couch was being rolled on the side walk, mattress was laying on the floor which caused dirt to get on it, and worse thing of all my 75 inch tv was cracked. Don‚Äôt recommend getting the insurance policy through wildcat movers as it covers near nothing to what retail cost of most furniture/ appliances are. Paid a hefty penny for this move to have a very poor experience, and now a broken tv. Not to mention I could not stay at my new place as my bed frame was made backwards by the team and my headboard fell over. Highly suggest spending money elsewhere for hopefully a better moving experience, especially with the dismal and lack of sympathy that HQ is giving from this whole damage claim."

Best part... they still charged me full cost for the move which I am currently am disputing with credit card and may report to bbb / Texas AG if not resolved shortly.

Furthermore, I have unpacked four pieces of furniture, and three of them are broken.

By far the biggest issue, I called and spoke with the operations manager. Immediately, he was defensive and combative. He even told me to make it quick, because he had other things to do. He then told me that customers were frustrating, and my expectations were not realistic. When I said my expectations were for my things to not be broken and arrive on time, he told me I was ""talking crazy."" He then told me that it wasn't his fault my things were broken.

8342,-0.013739669421487605,"I have used AB Moving company twice in the past and this was my third time using their service. The previous two times I worked with AB were very positive, which is why I have recommended them to friends and decided to choose them for my recent move. However, I will never use AB again. My story is detailed below, and I hope that this helps anyone out there who is in the process of choosing a moving company.

My move date was two weeks ago, and I am appalled by not only the issue I had during the service, but more importantly how the company has yet to respond to me and handle my request for a one-hour refund due to the issue I had that day. My moving window was 8 am - 10 am and the team showed up at 9:45 to get started. The movers packed things up quickly which was great and we were ready to head up north within 50 min - 1 hour. I was quoted about 2-3 hours max for this move, and we could have absolutely done the entire thing in 2 hours. My move was 45 minutes north, the movers had the correct address of the storage unit printed out on paper. We left my condo at the same time and headed up north, and I unfortunately waited at my storage unit entrance for an entire hour. About 30 minutes into me waiting, I called the movers and it seems he just put in the street address, not taking into account the city, so he ended up somewhere in a residential neighborhood about 20 minutes away from my storage unit (even though he knew we were heading to a storage unit) and literally just sat there, without trying to call me or reach me. Then we went through a series of sending pin locations to each other so that I could understand where he was, and he could understand where I was. It was majorly confusing and inconvenient and what is worse is that he had a horrible attitude about it. He hung up on me twice, and meanwhile, the AB moving clock was running along... $$$. For all I know, these guys were either on a joy ride or decided to stop for lunch and work the clock. By the time they arrived, he said maybe two words to me because I guess he was mad about his own mistake. He ended up knocking 15 minutes off of the price, which was ridiculous considering how long I waited. His team got everything from the truck into my storage unit within 10 minutes, so again the entire thing could have been done in 2 hours. I closed everything out with him and even gave his team a small tip because I didn't want him to do anything crazy and I decided I would take up the logistical issues with the AB moving company itself to process the one-hour refund.

I called the company and verbally gave my review to them saying that I needed a supervisor to call me back asap to discuss. This was two weeks ago and I still have not heard a thing. What is even worse/hilarious is that AB proceeded to send me a series of emails asking me to leave a review and I definitely let them have it each time. Still, NO response!! So here I am letting the public know the level of service this company will provide should you choose to go with them. They have really gone downhill.

**I just looked through some other reviews and see a lot of 5-star reviews, but if you scroll lower you will find a few 1-stars like mine, where you can see issues of movers running the clock like I experienced, so I am not sure what is going on with their Google reviews, maybe they are manipulating them somehow, but I do agree with what another reviewer said: you can find a more realistic view of the service on Yelp**"

I have moved before in the DFW area at least three times.  Every other moving company has always been a guy or two showing up with a truck and a dolly.

This company called the week before to confirm the appointment.  They called the day before as well and advised who would be showing up.  About half an hour before, I received a call from the movers.   They have a one time charge for showing up and don't start charging for mileage the second the van leaves the office.

Finally, the move was like clockwork.  We had some odd stuff to move as well as some loose items.  They were able to saran wrap almost everything that was exposed to keep the items from getting dirty.

In terms of valuables and TVs, they were able to use furniture matting, saran wrap, and straps to tie down the expensive items.

I had a move from out of state to DFW a few years back.  This was paid for by my company and I really enjoyed not having to move on my own for the first time.  Since then, Exodus Moving has been the only company to provide similar, if not better service and support.

Also saying, Call me, don‚Äôt text! So i‚Äôm like huh?! As i‚Äôm talking with my family on the other line. I go to call him where he literally start screaming through the phone accusing me and my family of taking advantage of him and that he would have the truck drive to office and park until we pay.

When not only was the call already being monitored with my family and 6 other people listending to the entire conversation.

Especially when i‚Äôm a man of God and have wayyyyyy to many people who can vouch for character. After this entire situation made me emotional while at my storage, I knew that he wasn‚Äôt nothing but the devil calling his own game. I guess he thought I would be dumb. NOT!!! Again, When God is on your side, there‚Äôs nothing you can do! I feel so sorry for the movers because they were really nice and patted me on the back after they saw that I was crying after speaking with ignorant manager. They both even gave me a fist üëäüèΩ dap after the unloading was completed. It made me feel better and even with the representatives working at the storage gave positive words after seeing tears flow from my eyes. I never experienced anyone attacking my character of taking advantage and trying to commit fraud. Lastly, When you have someone that puts that much emphasis on someone trying to advantage of them, it‚Äôs the opposite. He thought he could run game but didn‚Äôt succeed. Karma is always near.

5296,-0.023242694805194794,"Disappointment and frustration summarizes my move experience with this company. I usually don't write reviews but looking at all positive reviews and my completely opposite experience, I definitely think that majority of the reviews might be fake.

Here is a summary of my experience:
I moved my apartment with a different company in the past and have given away stuff since then. I say this to set the baseline since previous move company took 3 hours to complete the move while eco movers took 5 hours 45 minutes(!!) to move fewer items where everything was already packed. I simply chose this company because they had high customer ratings, so writing this review in case others use these ratings as a way to choose their movers. Back to story.. They estimated 4 hours saying that estimation is an upper bound and the overall move will very likely take shorter than that given the items I listed to them.
From the beginning, there were several issues with the moving process. The movers arrived in the morning and started calling me early in the morning (my move was scheduled for the afternoon). While that is not a big deal, I didn't realize that it was a huge sign of negligence and disorganized work. Later in the afternoon they arrived again (at the correct time) but overall they were so slow! They were not efficient and took significantly longer than expected to complete the move. The lead mover was especially moving with 0.5x speed. They were unprofessional that I had to ask them to wrap sensitive furniture with a blanket and without my notice, they would not do that and load the stuff as is. They attempted to move the monitors without any blanket and it took them 15 minutes to bring blankets from the truck when I asked them... I had packed everything else and only few pieces of furniture was supposed to be wrapped around and yet they required warning to do that. They didn't handle my belongings with care, resulting in damages to several items, lots of scratches and small damages on the furniture due to that. They took 3 hours to just load items to u-haul size truck and the truck was not even half way full to give the idea about the load of items. When they started unloading items at the destination, one of the elevators happened to stop working so the other elevator was the only one and could not be reserved. Even though the apartment complex had around 25 residents in total at the time (so imagine the most traffic that can be on the elevators during the move), they took their time to unload items which took almost another 2,5 hours making the elevator not being reserved as an excuse for the slowness.

To make matters worse, when I contacted the customer service team to address these issues and report that it is taking ridiculously long time,  I was met with an unhelpful attitude. They seemed uninterested in resolving my concerns and did not provide any helpful solutions. When the lead mover called them at the end, I heard the guy on the other side of the call saying that ""if you have any issues getting the payment, let me know"" or something along these lines!! What does that even mean?? They probably had issues with that in the past, no wonder why.

Another dishonesty I witnessed was a call to the lead mover who was next to me at the time and the conversation in a non-English language (probably thinking that I don't understand it) using the elevator not being reserved as an excuse for the whole delay. Luckily I knew Spanish and was able to understand the whole context and was able to reply back when the customer service representative called me and repeated the same things the lead mover told him.

Overall, I would not recommend this company to anyone in need of moving services. The entire experience was a complete disappointment and a waste of my time and money. A simple move was turned into a frustration and a lot of unplanned money as a return. As I mentioned to the customer service representative, it is **not** ok to scam people."

We can never repay them for what they did for us. I will be a lifelong customer and will refer them to anyone needing moving services!"

Because of the big rain that day, we started little bit late afternoon, but we worked non-stop till 12 AM! Not to mention it was from second floor to second floor, from Dallas to Plano.

For the price, they gave us the discounted hour rate which is the lowest compare to other quote.

Now I have new understanding of the name ""AM Moving"", it means not start working at AM but work till AM midnight! Highly recommend it!"

They were supposed to arrive between 1 - 4 pm time window, but showed up at my door at 7 pm. Did not apologize for their tardiness and proceeded everything with negative attitude off the start. I lived in a small apartment and had pre-packed everything (into 15 large boxes) with practically no furniture before their arrival. Inconceivable to anyone's belief, it took them THREE LONG HOURS to move these 15 large boxes out of my old place. How? these guys obviously charge by hours.
If you would like to finish your move in a timely manner without being ripped off, please consider other moving companies in the area."

If you chose to use them- don‚Äôt expect to see your stuff for two weeks (after they said 3-10 days), they won‚Äôt communicate about delays unless you reach out to them and even then the time frames will get changed several times. The CEO says let me talk with the management team to see what kind of discount I can get you. (The management team is him and his wife according to the website). Their solution? Let me offer you 5% off the second half of your payment‚Ä¶not even the whole thing.

So you finally get your belongings great‚Ä¶ except your tv is missing, several things are broken, and they don‚Äôt even bring the pieces for you to put together a bed frame. The delivery drivers drop a desk and break it while coming in.

So you reach back out, they say they will look for your tv, pay you for some of the broken objects,  and give you a bed frame they have in the warehouse‚Ä¶ so you want to give me a USED BEDFRAME/HEADBOARD THAT YOU LOST FOR SOMEONE ELSE???? Disgusting no thanks.

After 2 more weeks they find your tv and say they are ‚Äúworking to schedule a delivery‚Äù. No other comments made. Then two days later the whole company is blowing up your phone because they are now in the area and want to deliver it now. Problem being, no notice was given of delivery so both my husband and I are at work. My husbands ends up having it delivered to his job to put in the back of his pickup truck and hopes no one steals it. They tried telling me ‚Äúwe contacted you two days ago‚Äù and had a snarky tone behind the message and tried to back track when I sent them a screenshot of what was said to me and tried to say ‚Äúthey are trying to schedule it now‚Äù. No they are saying we are dropping it off at this moment because we can‚Äôt deliver it tomorrow. (Even though our stuff at the beginning was delayed several times supposedly because other people couldn‚Äôt accept their belongings at the original scheduled times)

Franco will act amazing until he collects your money, then he stops caring. He couldn‚Äôt even be bothered to learn my husbands name and kept calling him some name that he made up. He also thought he was just talking to my husband at one point and tried to claim he told me things and then when I made it known I was on the phone, he wanted to change what he was saying.

The CEO acts like he will take care of you to get you off the phone then he just puts you in contact with customer service who does practically nothing. He runs from difficult situations and makes other people deal with it.

You can ignore the following quotes on their website: ‚Äúensure every deadline is met‚Äù ‚Äúwe work with transparency, trust, and empathy‚Äù

I wouldn‚Äôt have cared about any of these issues, if they just learned to communicate. And I said that several times before I had to start getting rude with them.

This whole company is a joke. Do yourself a favor and stay FAR AWAY from these people.

They attempted to do the bare minimum to fix this whole ordeal but couldn‚Äôt even handle that."

The team, led by Joel, arrived on time and was friendly. Unfortunately, they took five hours to move less furniture than my roommate's company, AB Moving, who took 3 hours. Joel told me that it was a long walk to the elevator but AB Moving had to do the exact same walk with more furniture, a washer & dryer, and a full sized sectional.

The team also forgot to load up my belongings in my storage unit which I showed them in person and also texted to remind them. They left a few things inside my apartment as well.

I was disappointed that I had to go back and get those things myself - that was the point of hiring a moving company.

Customer Service also did not attempt to de-escalate the matter. I called on the day of the move and spoke to a Joe, Assistant Manager, who said he would call me back that day but did not. The following Monday, when the Operations Manager, Rod, called me to collect payment, it felt like they did not believe me and that it was my fault that the move had taken so long.

When I told Rod that I did not feel like it was okay that Joe did not call me back on Saturday, as he promised, Rod replied ""Well, I'm calling you back today. Does it make a difference if I called Saturday or just a few days later on Monday?"".... this is a terrible response! Keep your promises or don't make them.

First off, I never got a call to say they were on the way like others; although they did show up on time. It took them 20 minutes to actually get started moving things - the older guy (Mannys dad, I would later learn) was yelling at theme to move faster. The two guys just stood around lots looking at him while he loaded up. Then they got lost on the way to my first storage location. This wasted another 10 minutes. They stood around a lot at the storage facility and I was getting uncomfortable bc I am used to movers hustling. They were on a Sunday stroll (on my dime). Once we got to my final destination, they started hustling so I appreciated that. Then once it was time to divvy up, they stood around for another ten minutes. When I told Manny this over the phone, he said ‚Äúmy guys don‚Äôt stand around.‚Äù Hate to break it to you manny, but they did. Laziest movers I‚Äôve ever encountered (not his dad though). I wish I had recorded them standing around doing nothing half of the time.

I was quoted at $500 for two hours. It took them 3.75 hours. I attempted to get him to come down to 3 hours bc that‚Äôs the actual amount of time the two guys worked (at a snails pace). So I ended paying $679. Oh, and that‚Äôs on top of the $99 deposit, which they don‚Äôt tell you is not included.

They were relatively efficient. The second stop was a disaster. Be careful what you list on your inventory because if you forget to list one thing or list something incorrectly (I.e. a bag instead of a box) they will refuse to move it and get upset. I forgot to list a few items like night stands, office chair, tv, and the guys were not happy. I called the office and the person I spoke to assured my move would be taken care of. They ended up moving a majority of our stuff, but did not take some of the large items and we had to make several trips back ourselves. The move ended up taking 7 hours and costing nearly $1,300 which is crazy. The guys were exhausted and had another move after us. Honestly the company should‚Äôve sent extra hands.

4524,-0.03110943418560606,"I was originally quoted 3 hours to move from Kent to Woodinville at $159/hour. However, I transferred to another unit within my complex and the move only took 2.5 hours, including drive time from their warehouse. The movers did not speak English well, ruined the fresh paint on my front door, and continued to wear shoes on my brand new carpet, despite requesting runners or shoe covers MULTIPLE TIMES.

To make matters worse, I was asked to pay 3.5 hours, and all we did was move across the parking lot. I disputed the last hour (because it only took 2.5 hours) but the manager refused to adjust the price, stating estimates are ‚Äúsubject to change,‚Äù and that the extra hour was ‚Äúdrive time‚Äù back to their warehouse‚Ä¶ even though this was never disclosed to me, or mentioned in their estimate, etc.

My question is, how can I be quoted a 3 hour job (to move to Woodinville) but be asked to pay a 3.5 hour job when I was merely moving into another building? And if my original estimate included ‚Äúdrive time,‚Äù where is this extra hour coming from? This company does not appear reputable‚Ä¶ I will be filing a small claim and NEVER recommend this company to anyone looking for movers.

Addendum. My review of Eco Movers remains as the most DISHONEST, UNPROFESSIONAL moving company I have EVER worked with. Below is a list of inaccuracies in their response to my review:

1. If they ‚Äúdisclosed‚Äù drive time, then the original quote of 3 hours should have included this??? Think again.

2. I was charged $516.75 to move three pieces of NON-HEAVY furniture and 12 small boxes. We merely went across the parking lot!!!

3. I disputed the last hour but the manager REFUSED to take anything more than 15 minutes off. I am still debating whether I should take that last hour ($159) to small claims court.

4. My ‚Äúquote‚Äù was to move to Woodinville, not to transfer units within my same apartment complex. And it turned out I only had 12 boxes instead of the estimated 15-20.

5. Eco Movers called at 749 am stating they would be at my apartment in 50 minutes‚Ä¶ HOWEVER, they did not call again until 850 am. So stating they were at my apartment at 824 am is obviously a lie!!!

6. It took 1.5 hours to load my belongings, go to my new unit, and unload my belongings‚Ä¶ HOWEVER, I was charged 3.5 hours. It does not take two hours to get to Woodinville and back, not even during rush hour!!!

7. I was told my job would take 3 hours to move a mattress, dresser, ottoman, and 15-20 boxes to Woodinville. The 4 hours was to ‚Äúreserve a time slot,‚Äù and it was NEVER disclosed to me that I would be charged ‚Äúdrive time.‚Äù"

And at this time, given the bed frame pieces were missing we cannot reassemble it again, we have to put all the remaining bed frame pieces back to the storage, and I have to pay junk removal company to remove the remaining pieces. My lost here is the waste hours of moving plus the junk removal fee. Plus, they made me lost at some other stuff, like 5-6 items are missing during the third moving.

I hope that customer wasn't mad at them.  Everything about my move was a disaster.  Transferring electricity, internet, my apartment move-in date getting changed twice.

I asked how long it would take for the other truck to arrive. They could not give me the specific¬†time. So then I get a call from a lady at AB Moving. Come to find out the subcontracted the job out to some random movers that do not follow directions and can't speak English. Then AB movers call me and tell me they are going to change my start time to 1 pm and give me a small discount that doesn't amount to anything.

6994,-0.035374499714122355,"TL;DR - Worst moving experience ever. At best, this ""company"" is disorganized, unprepared and thoughtless. At worst, they're crooks not completing jobs and ripping people off. Either way, go elsewhere.

First of all, I hardly ever leave bad reviews. But I feel like not warning others about this ""business"" is doing the world a disservice. I have moved 6 times in the last decade and used AM Moving for 4 of them. The first 3 times they were great. However, this last summer was my first time using them since they went under new ownership. And boy, did it show. From beginning to end, it was a complete and total nightmare.

To start, the movers were supposed to show up between 9-11am. We were packed and ready for them at 9. They decide to grace us with their presence at 11:45. The 3 movers spoke not a word of English, and I mean not. One. Word. I speak some broken Spanish, but you'd think they'd at least learn ""bedroom"" or ""living room"" as movers? It made communication virtually impossible. They also clearly had little to no experience as movers. One man looked like he was about 65yo and had no business lifting some of the furniture. Another looked 17yo and barely helped he was so bored with the job. Every time I saw him, he was scrolling on his phone.

The estimate was for 8 hours - they were supposed to move everything out of our 3-bd house and unload at our new house, then go to our second stop (storage unit) load up the truck and unload a second time. The truck the movers brought was the TINIEST moving truck I've ever seen in my life. It didn't fit everything from our house, so they had to do 2 trips, taking several hours.

They unnecessarily disassembled my bed frame, removing each slat by hand with an allen wrench (they didn't have a drill or any proper tools). I've moved this bed 5 times, and never seen any mover disassemble the slats. Seemingly this was done in an effort to waste more time.

They said they'd take a 30 min. lunch and came back an hour and a half later. They refused to take our tvs off the wall mounts or move our washer/dryer (which, fine if that's the company policy, but that was never explained to me when I booked the job).

At 10pm, they hadn't even gone to our storage unit yet. They quit and said they were tired and that someone would call me the next day to book a new crew to unload our storage unit. So they didn't finish the agreed-upon job and left us high and dry. Of course I didn't hear from anyone the next day, so I was forced to spend another $800 to book a new company to move everything out of our storage unit.

Luckily I disputed the $1,500 charge that showed up on my credit card as they quit halfway through the job. I called and emailed the owner with no response. I later learned that bringing a too-small truck for moving jobs and taking forever is part of a scam other moving companies have done. It's a way to get out of finishing jobs while still charging the full hourly rate amount. It's too bad because AM Moving used to be my go-to before they got this new owner. What a joke."

I was told that Google maps got them lost. I asked, why we were supposed to pay for that? He added, we also had to prep the truck. I looked at him and said, this was an unload. The only thing they needed was a dolly, however, they bought a huge truck, which actually took up a lot of space in the small parking lot. In addition, when he first arrived he told us that he thought it was a load and he said there was a four hour minimum. I told him I was quoted by Jesus for a one hour minimum and that we were unloading not loading. He had to call Jesus and get it all straightened out. This took an additional 10 minutes. I have tried calling them  on multiple occasions to talk to Jesus about a 30 minute refund and have not heard back in four days. Very disappointing!

I was scheduled to move from 8 AM - 12 PM. However, I didn't receive any call or messages at 8 AM. So, I had to call them at 8:15 to confirm my move. Cindy, who has been very responsive, told me that she would contact the movers to call me. However, I did not receive a call from my movers until 9 AM.

That is when I found out that they are going to be late and arrive around 11:30 AM. I get things happen and they might be delayed. However, I had to call them persistently (at least 3 times) to call me back. Moving day is a stressful day and it got on the wrong foot from the beginning. I had packed everything and had nothing to do for 2.5 hours because of the late notice.

It would've been all fine if the movers moved everything with care. However, a lot of my furnitures were damaged and not handled properly. From damaged wooden chairs to cracked acrylic side tables. It is a mess. When I used a different company last year (Reliable moving), I did not have this problem. They wrapped everything and were gentle with everything. However, with Eco Movers, there is literally a scratch on every single wooden furniture.

I had made an appointment for them to move me and when it was 30 minutes past the appointment time, I called the office.  The office manager, Tona, told me they would be there shortly.  They eventually arrived two hours late.

They were absolutely terrible; they had a very bad attitude and refused to wrap my furniture with shrink wrap or blankets and turned a two hour move into a four hour move.  One of the movers was Mexican and he did about 90% of the work. The other two black men didn't do anything but stand around and talk and complain.

On the way to my new location, they took a very long unnecessary route and even stopped for lunch at McDonald's and then tried add their lunch time into their move time.  I had followed them and had to sit and wait in my car until they were done eating at McDonald's....about 45 minutes.

Before they unloaded my items, they guy in charge tried to get me to pay for a four hour move with my credit card.  I said I would only pay for a two hour move since two of them hardly did any work and for the stop at McDonald's.  He said they would not unload my items until I paid them.  I called the owner, Bobby and after arguing with him for awhile he told them to unload my items.  They finally did and that was when I realized that numerous items were broken.

I refused to pay them and called owner Bobby again. I told him what happened and I wanted him to come to my house and see damage they had done.  He said he would call me back but never did.  I kept calling him he would not answer.  The guy in charge became very belligerent and started yelling at me in the front yard of my house.

I repeated to him that I was not going to pay them until the Bobby came and saw the damage they had done to my items. He called Bobby and apparently Bobby told him not to leave without getting my credit card info or he would not pay them.   At this point the guy got very aggressive, yelling at me then got up in my face and I thought he was going to hit me; telling me they were not going to leave until I gave him my credit card info.

At that point I told him to get off my property - he refused to leave and he started making a scene, yelling at me as loud as he could in a threatening manner.  A couple of my new neighbors came out of their houses to see what was going on.  I called the Garland Police who arrived in just a few minutes.  When they saw the police coming they got in their van and took off.

The police took after after them, caught them and brought them back to my property to sort out what happened.  I showed the officer the damage done and told him that they tried to overcharge me and one was getting violent and refused to get off my property.  The officer told them to leave and that if they came back on my property, they would be arrested for trespassing.

They left and later I spoke to the office manager, Tona, and told her everything that had transpired and emailed her photos of my damaged items.  She started arguing with me, defending the movers.  I told her I was not going to pay Exodus Moving & Storage until I found out how much the cost was to repair my damaged items. I never hear back from them.

I would certainly advise those looking to have their furniture moved to choose another mover as sure would not want anyone to go through the nightmare I went through.

He quoted $1,800 and saw no reason that it would be any more expensive. The lead mover then asked me again to show him what was to be moved. Just wasting time in my opinion.

We soon asked what was taking so long, since we should‚Äôve been at the new apartment unloading by that time. They stated that our apartment was far away from the truck, that was causing the long wait time to get back upstairs...

My building has visitor parking that I‚Äôd blocked, but they chose to park far up the hill because they felt that their truck would not fit in the parking spot because of the length, which was proven wrong because the next day, they parked in front of the building. IThey then took 20 minute trips every hour to go up the hill to fetch material. They took over 9 hours to pack, even though I‚Äôd already packed half the apartment. When I spoke with phone staff, they said that it looked like the crew had front loaded some of the packing that is typically done on moving day such as wrapping furniture. And that I should expect moving day to be a lot faster. They were wrong again.
On moving day, they damaged a door which was partly covered by insurance. They completely destroyed a Lego set that took me over 3 weeks to complete. As a professional moving service, I expected better communication for what they can and cannot move.
And after all this, I paid through my nose even though I‚Äôd already packed half of my 2bed apartment. This significantly exceeded the estimate that the phone staff claimed in the worst case scenario if I did 0 packing, after I provided a detailed inventory of all items in my home."

We requested 3 movers who showed up an hour late.  We requested them at 8 am, and they did not arrive until after 9 am.  Before they started moving we were shown their ‚Äúmoving contract‚Äù which stated if we wanted to pay in any other form other than cash we would be changed a 5% fee.  If we were going to pay with credit card, ‚Äúwe still needed to provide a nice tip for his men ""IN CASH.‚Äù  I should have told them to leave during this discussion, as this is how shady and crooked this company is.  We have used other moving companies in the past and it has never taken over 3 hour to move us from one location to another location (45 minutes apart).  This move was 3 streets over and less an half a mile.  It took this company 4.5 hours to move us.  Less than 45 minutes into the move one of their men quit/or was fired for causing excessive damage to our properties and our furniture.  Our master bedroom door was scratched, a large scratch from one side of the door to other side, there were several scratches and a dents all the way down the stairs and finally the entryway light fixtures was shattered with they slammed a book case into it.  I asked several times for the NOT to take certain pieces apart, for example, they took my dining room table apart, when I purchased it in once piece and it was delivered from the store in one piece and never taken apart, but the movers would not listen to me and continued to take different pieces of furniture apart that didn‚Äôt need to be taken apart, wasting more time and running up the bill.  Once at the new house, the put a door dent with the door knob in the side of the hall way and they ripped the dryer tubing when attempting to install the dryer.  I had to pay my handyman, who was there doing a garage remodel for me to go to home depot and purchase the repair parts and then make the repair.  Several pieces of furniture were damaged as well.  I have contacted the company SEVERAL times trying to get a reimbursement for the damage and repairs we have had to make and the company doesn‚Äôt care and will not reimburse us.  When we went to pay, we gave them 500.00 cash for a 489.00 bill.  No change was provided as they didn‚Äôt have any change, yet they demand to be paid in cash.

After my first review I was asked to call back so that they could take care of the issue, but what I received was more lack of professionalism, where the owner went into a rant about how I did not know about the moving industry (agree that is why I hired them) and how he was frustrated that gave him a bad review, push came to shove he wasted my time, did not allow me to speak and did not solve the issue.
Horrible customer service and now I see why he has a whole bunch of unprofessional and mis leading prices reviews. Anyways if these are his actions in person, I would not doubt that he uses fake reviews as good clients, I would really be very thorough in using such a dishonest company.

Review 1
Owner is a nice guy but misleading in the way they charge, they provide one price initially but the end price is completely different and the worst part is that they are not transparent about it. They are pretty good as movers but do take their time, not sure if it was to rank up hours but once I mentioned it they started to move faster. A real disappointment is when they damaged one of my chairs and they promised to pay for it after we payed the move.

It has been a year since that happened and they did not replace or pay for it and threatened me with their insurance company because they would pay less. Neither them nor the insurance company were responsible. I would not use them for that single reason, this was just a chair can you imagine if the damage would have been bigger."

3. Were not careful while moving the furniture -- dinged two walls and scratched the door

She steered us away from some situations that could have put us in a bad financial position in the future.

They dumped most of everything in my garage including very heavy boxes that I had to empty out there and carry the contents inside.

They stole a box of vitamin supplements and medication's that I had left open to take with me. It was in my kitchen and it had to of been taken right away because it would've been one of the first boxes to go outside the door.
It never made it to my home and I'm very disappointed in the integrity of this company. When I called to report it they told me I had a standard contract but they never asked me to sign any other or offered any other options.
When I told him I needed to file a police report due to the nature of the items missing, they told me exactly how to do it. They have been down this road before. Please movers beware! If you value your things‚Ä¶ Do not use this company!"

Before purchasing this deal I called an asked lots of question on availability, if wrapping furniture was included and a few other details. I was told that shrink wrapping furniture was no extra charge and they did it to protect furniture. Within seconds of walking in the house one of the crew said we are going to charge you $5 per piece of furniture to wrap it. I explained that I spoke with Tanya and she told me it was included. They walk through the house speaking Spanish and they get to the home office, and said we are moving that (amior) it is too heavy, So I asked them to call Tonya and they because and thought the conversation to call her a ""B"" in Spanish and cussing. Of course she was no where to be found and they refused to do anything until I agreed to pay the extra to wrap the furniture or they would walk. They actually got in the and was leaving until their manager told them that they had to stay. I got the impression that they were subcontractor. Needless to say paid over $800 because they were so slow and they left enough stuff to fill a small u-haul. I ended up hiring another person to move the piece of furniture that they refused to move. In reality this move cost me $1000+ to move three miles. One person of the crew was willing to do the work, one person who seamed to be the leader was very slow and the last one who was very vocal cussed and called Tonya as many bad names in Spanish as you can think of. I had to move and it I would have had more time I would have allowed them to leave and found another company.

They were hired on Angie's List and when I posted the review they replied with wrong details about my move.  This was a 3 mile move!"

They had no complaints and their moves were much bigger. This move was however a nightmare for a 2 Bedroom condo which wasn't even fully furnished.
Lets start by them showing up 40min late, when moving into an HOA timing is absolutely critical. 2) They charge by the hour, this is some thing which was a big mistake. First hour I was like, ok this is going fast. After that It was slow motion.  As I bought my furniture last 2 years it all fit in the elevator except 1 piece. I told them this before the job. All of a sudden these kids are telling me there are 3-5 pieces they have to take down the stairs for an expensive fee.
It took this group of 3 kids they sent to move a 2 bedroom place 7 hours, which is crazy!!!! Then I told them since we were going to be able to get to the condo that we had to move items to a storage unit 1 mile away. Gave them address and would meet there. Took me 10 min to get there. Had to wait over 45 min for them to show up. I had to call them what happened are they even coming.
As I stood outside watching them move Items into storage with 3 ppl. There were times no one even came to the truck for over 10-15 min. Found myself getting out and going to find out where they were.
End story it took 9 hours for them to move a 2 bedroom condo that was already pre boxed up. The head kid knew I was frustrated and called his boss.
He wanted to know why I was frustrated? 9 hours for this move was crazy and I had sent him pics of the items days before. His only answer was they had to move items down stairs (I'm sorry walking down 4 flights does not take hours) and maybe they were too cautious with safety. ( BS thats called milking the clock)
The only answer he had was they were going to take one hour off and not charge me the fee for walking down the stairs.
I'm SORRY BUT TAKING ONE HOUR OFF of a 9 Hour job that they milked the time that should of only taken 4-5 hours Max. I""M sorry if i don't sound grateful that you over charged me Doubled but only going to take 1 hour off.

I have to move my items into my condo now. Lets say I will not be using this company. I will not be referring any friends to them and letting people know around me the hustle they have going on.

11044,-0.24722222222222223,"I want to express my appreciation for Leandro the way he took the time and his hard work he put in for us over these past few weeks. It made all the difference to know that he was mindful of the details. He made the home renting process a breeze, and we couldn‚Äôt have done it without his expertise and guidance.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you."

10896,-0.2514172335600907,"Found what I needed. But as someone finding an apartment for the first time in this area and not from Miami, the experience was HORRENDOUS. I dealt with Fransisco and he was rude, unprofessional and would yell on the phone and make comments that are not needed to someone who is simply asking questions since it was my first time using a realtor and renting in this area. He would get frustrated and would never tell me or my roommate upfront about any fees that we needed to pay, he would just tell us to ""pay this and pay that"" without explaining anything or why we need to do this. And when we would ask, he would get frustrated and either stop texting or not answer phone calls, but eventually he would answer what we needed to be answered, but it was after rude texts or phone calls.

I had to contact the actual building manager and he sat me down and explained everything to me and what needed to happen. Fransisco seemed as if he was merely interested in his cut and then never heard from him again. -- Again, the office was in the right location  and showed the appropiate apartments I was looking for, but I will never recommend Fransisco to anyone. Horrible Horrible service and was not happy with his services."

9518,-0.26,Worst moving company. Only focuses on sales and fake promises. Their guys broke our stuff and loittered around to add up hours. When I complained they did not respond.

They weren't breaking any road rules, as I was driving behind them.  The cop stop them  due to some stupid reason that should have  been  a warning if that. They still finish the job like professionals when they got to the second location even after that upset."
1591,-0.26636363636363636,Horrible service. Started hourly clock b4 one thing was moved. Didn't organize things once placed at new place. Destroyed the wood railing of expensive Basset King Bed by screwing through wood!!!!! Was about to leave a sofa chair undone that they took apart. Left plastic wrap on things without asking me if I wanted it left on or not. I have definitely had better moving services and I would not recommend or ever use AB Moving again. Still left a $100 cash tip but shouldn't have given anything besides pay for the horrible move. At least the move was completed.
3338,-0.26666666666666666,"Our movers showed up nearly an hour late after calling/texting that they were 10min away. Upon arrival, it was as though they had never worked a move before.

I made at least 4 calls and sent 2 emails regarding the quality of their move as well as an erroneous overcharge of over $200 with no response. Do not trust this company with your move."

They did not want to move my stuff because of the distance between where I had to park and the elevator. I spent an extra of paid time trying to park in a spot on a Saturday to make the move easier on them. I have worked with other movers in the past and this experience was the worst. My dad who came to help me move missed his flight because of all this as well. Absolute WORST experience ever!!!!!

The ""cash offer"" is about $100k less than the appraised value of our house taking into account the repairs that we need to make. Repeated attempts to request that no further ""offers"" be made have fallen on deaf ears. This is harassment at its worst."
9888,-0.335,"I wish I could give negative stars.  DO NOT use this company.  Terrible customer service and predatory sales practices.  If you choose to pay hourly, they will go as slowly as possible.  They will disassemble everything possible and lose parts.  Take pictures of everything because they will damage things and then deny it.  Do not buy the insurance.  It‚Äôs worthless.  I have damage to my furniture and they refuse to compensate.  Don‚Äôt fall for their Sleep Number bed service that costs extra.
